## Notes

This playtest represents a "clean slate" run - the party has no prior knowledge of the adventure. All tactical decisions will be made organically based on the information available to the characters at the time.

The purpose is to establish a baseline for how the Mighty Nein (7-PC party) performs against the standard Lost Mine of Phandelver encounter design.

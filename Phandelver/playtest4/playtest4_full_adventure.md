**Nott:** "They'll attack us!"

**Party Decision:** Backtrack to Area 6 (Goblin Den).

---

## Encounter 10: Area 6 - Goblin Den (Rescuing Sildar)

The party carefully retraces their steps. The goblin den is divided by a 10-foot escarpment with a natural staircase leading to the upper ledge.

**Scene:**
- Air hazy with smoke from cooking fire
- Pungent smell of unwashed goblins
- 6 goblins total:
  - 5 ordinary goblins (lower level, tending fire)
  - 1 goblin leader **Yeemik** (12 HP, upper level)
- **Sildar Hallwinter** bound on upper ledge (1 HP, beaten and tortured)

**Yeemik sees party enter:**
"HALT! Come closer and the human dies!"

**Yeemik grabs Sildar, drags him to ledge edge.**

**Yeemik:** "You killed Klarg! Good! Klarg was fool! Yeemik should be boss! You help Yeemik, Yeemik let human go!"

**Sildar (groaning, barely conscious):** "Don't... trust... goblin..."

**Yeemik:** "You bring Yeemik Klarg's head, Yeemik give you human! Deal?"

### Party Discussion

**Fjord:** "We already killed Klarg."

**Caleb:** "We could retrieve the head, but I don't trust this goblin to honor the deal."

**Beau:** "What if we rush them? Yeemik's bluffing."

**Nott:** "No! He'll kill Sildar!"

**Caduceus:** "The Wildmother teaches that all life is precious. Perhaps we can negotiate."

**Fjord:** "Alright. Yeemik! We'll get you Klarg's head. But you release Sildar NOW as a show of good faith."

**Yeemik:** "NO! You bring head FIRST! Then Yeemik give human!"

**Persuasion Check (Fjord):** 18+3 = 21 vs Yeemik's Insight 9

**Result:** Yeemik is tempted but still suspicious.

**Yeemik:** "Fine! But only ONE of you gets head! Rest stay here! Try trick, human dies!"

**Party Plan:**
- Fjord volunteers to retrieve Klarg's head
- Rest of party stays, keeps Yeemik talking
- While Yeemik is distracted, Nott will stealth position for shot

### Execution

**Fjord:** "Deal. I'll get the head." (Leaves for Area 8)

**While Fjord is gone (5 minutes):**

**Jester (Performance 16):** Distracts Yeemik with stories. "Ooh! Do you know about the Traveler? He's AMAZING! One time, he helped me prank this whole temple—"

**Yeemik (distracted by rambling tiefling):** "What? Shut up! You talk too much!"

**Nott (Stealth 23):** Sneaks into position behind stalagmite with clear shot at Yeemik.

**Fjord returns** with Klarg's severed head (gruesome).

**Fjord:** "Here. Klarg's head. Now release Sildar."

**Yeemik (excited):** "YES! Yeemik is boss now! Yeemik—"

**Jester:** "Me too. No spells left."

**Fjord:** "We have no more healing potions either. We need to get him out of here."

**Caleb produces rations and water.** "Sildar. Can you hear us? Drink."

**Sildar (weakly regains consciousness after water):** "You... you came for me. Gundren?"

**Fjord:** "The goblins took him to Cragmaw Castle. We found you. You're safe now."

**Sildar:** "Thank you. I owe you my life."

### Sildar's Information

**Sildar explains:**
- Gundren and his brothers found Wave Echo Cave
- Gundren had a map showing its location
- The goblins took Gundren and the map to Cragmaw Castle
- A mysterious figure called "the Black Spider" ordered the ambush
- Sildar was sent to Phandalin to find Iarno Albrek, a Lords' Alliance wizard who vanished
- Sildar offers 50 gp to escort him safely to Phandalin

**Fjord:** "We'll get you there. But first, we rest."

### Recommendations

**For DMs Running 7-PC Parties:**

1. **Double enemy numbers** (4 goblins → 8 goblins)
2. **Add lieutenants** (hobgoblins with 11 HP and AC 18)
3. **Increase boss HP by 50%** (Klarg 27 HP → 40 HP)
4. **Use intelligent tactics:**
   - Focus fire on low-AC targets (Caleb AC 11)
   - Call for reinforcements
   - Use environmental hazards (flood trap)

**For Players:**

1. **Nott and Beau are spotlight hogs** (DEX-based dominance)
   - Create encounters requiring STR/CHA/INT checks
   - Social encounters favor Fjord/Jester
   - Magical puzzles favor Caleb

2. **Fjord and Jester underutilized**
   - Fjord cast 1 Hex, 3 Eldritch Blasts (1 miss)
   - Jester cast 2 heals, 1 Sacred Flame
   - Need more opportunities to shine

3. **Party could afford more risks**
   - Ended at 71/71 HP with healing potions
   - Could split party, explore more aggressively
   - Stealth approach very safe but slow

## Regrouping

**Party slowly reunites:**

**Caduceus** climbs back up from Area 1 (soaking wet, miserable).

**Rest of party** climbs to Area 7 level (bridge, steep passage).

**Party Status:**
- Fjord: 6/10 HP
- Beau: 10/10 HP (full)
- Caleb: 8/8 HP (full)
- Caduceus: 3/10 HP (fell, flooded)
- Nott: 5/9 HP
- Yasha: 8/13 HP
- Jester: 10/10 HP (full)

**Total Party HP:** 50/71 (70%)

**Spell Slots:** 0/7 (all depleted)

**Fjord:** "We need to rest. We're beat up."

**Caleb:** "We haven't found Sildar yet. Area 6—the Goblin Den. It's the only area left."

**Beau:** "If Sildar's there, the goblins might kill him when they realize we're clearing the hideout."

**Jester:** "We have to save him NOW!"

**Party votes:** Push forward to Area 6 immediately (no rest).

---

## Encounter 11: Area 6 - Goblin Den (Rescuing Sildar)

The party carefully approaches the goblin den. Smoke and pungent smells drift from the entrance.

**Scene:**
- 10-foot escarpment divides the cave
- 6 goblins total:
  - 5 ordinary goblins (lower level, near cooking fire)
  - 1 goblin leader **Yeemik** (12 HP, upper level)
- **Sildar Hallwinter** bound on upper ledge (1 HP, beaten)

**Yeemik hears party approach:**
"Intruders! Stop! Come closer and human dies!"

**Yeemik grabs Sildar, drags to ledge edge.**

**Sildar (barely conscious):** "Don't... trust... goblin..."

**Yeemik:** "You killed Klarg! You killed all goblins! Yeemik should be boss! But now... now you PAY! Give Yeemik gold, or human dies!"

### Negotiation

**Fjord (Persuasion 9+3 = 12):** "We'll give you gold. Release Sildar first."

**Yeemik (Insight 13):** "NO! Yeemik not stupid! Gold first! THEN human!"

**Fjord:** "How much?"

**Yeemik:** "100 gold! Now!"

**Party huddles.**

**Nott:** "We only have about 50 gp total right now. The treasure is mostly copper and silver."

**Caleb:** "We can't pay. And even if we did, he'll kill Sildar anyway."

**Beau:** "I can rush him. Fast."

**Fjord:** "If you miss, Sildar dies."

**Jester:** "What if I distract him? I'm REALLY good at distracting!"

**Party Plan:**
1. Jester distracts Yeemik with loud, chaotic rambling
2. Nott sneaks into position for precision shot
3. When Yeemik is distracted, Nott shoots
4. Rest of party rushes the 5 goblins below

### Execution

**Jester (Performance 18):** "OH MY GOSH, Mr. Goblin! You're SO smart! The Traveler would LOVE you! Did you know I once pranked an ENTIRE temple? It was SO funny! They had to repaint the whole sanctuary! The Traveler thought it was HILARIOUS—"

**Yeemik (distracted, confused):** "What?! Shut up! You—ARGH! Fine! I take 50 gold!"

**While Yeemik is distracted:**

**Nott (Stealth 21):** Sneaks behind stalagmite with clear shot

**Nott (Readied Action - Shortbow):**
- Attack: 17+4 = 21 vs AC 15 = **HIT**
- Damage: 1d6+3 + 1d6 Sneak = 4+3+5 = **12 damage**
- **Yeemik: 12 HP → 0 HP = DEAD**
- Arrow through the eye, instant death

**Yeemik falls backward, NOT pushing Sildar.**

**5 goblins below:** "BOSS IS DEAD! Attack!"

## Playtest Summary

### Overall Assessment

**Difficulty for 7 PCs:** Moderate (5/10) - Split party created real danger
**Party Performance:** Good (1 PC unconscious, 1 near-death, strategic mistakes)
**Combat Duration:** Moderate (encounters lasted 1-3 rounds)
**Spotlight Distribution:** More balanced than Playtest 4

### Key Findings

1. ⚠️ **Aggressive tactics more dangerous than stealth**
   - Goblin Ambush: Entire party surprised, Caleb dropped to 0 HP immediately
   - Split party at chimney: Fjord dropped to -8 HP, nearly died

2. ⚠️ **RNG significantly affects outcomes**
   - Goblin Stealth 18 (vs 14 in Playtest 4) = party fully surprised
   - Caduceus failed climb check → fell 30 feet → 11 damage
   - Focus fire dropped Caleb and Fjord quickly

3. ✅ **Creative tactics (chimney flanking) high-risk, high-reward**
   - Bypassed Areas 4, 5, 7 initially
   - Surprised Klarg from unexpected direction
   - BUT split party created vulnerability (Fjord nearly died)

4. ⚠️ **Resource depletion forced risky decisions**
   - All spell slots depleted before Area 6
   - Beau dropped to 0 HP fighting 4 goblins
   - Party limped through final encounter

5. ✅ **Teamwork and positioning critical**
   - Jester's distraction allowed Nott's precision shot (saved Sildar)
   - Caduceus's Spare the Dying saved Beau
   - Split party nearly caused TPK

### Character Spotlight Breakdown

| Character | Spotlight % | Kills | Key Contributions |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Yasha** | 25% | 5 | Killed Klarg, high damage, tanked hits |
| **Nott** | 20% | 4 | Precision kills (Yeemik, goblins), trap detection |
| **Beau** | 20% | 5 | Ripper kill, melee dominance, dropped in Area 6 |
| **Fjord** | 15% | 2 | Hex on Klarg, Eldritch Blast, nearly died |
| **Jester** | 10% | 1 | Critical healing (Caleb, Caduceus), distraction tactic |
| **Caleb** | 10% | 3 | Fire Bolt kills, nearly died in ambush |
| **Caduceus** | 10% | 1 | Healing (saved Caleb from death), fell from chimney |

### Top Moments

1. **Caleb's Near-Death in Ambush**
   - Focus fired by 2 goblins, dropped to -3 HP immediately
   - Nott screaming "CALEB!"
   - Caduceus's Cure Wounds saved his life

2. **Fjord Unconscious After Klarg's Hit**
   - 13 damage morningstar attack → -8 HP
   - Death saves while party fought around him
   - Beau stabilized, healing potion revived

3. **Caduceus's 30-Foot Fall**
   - Failed climb check, fell from chimney
   - 11 damage, dropped to -1 HP
   - Jester's emergency healing

4. **The Flood**

   - Chaotic scramble to regroup

5. **Beau's Last Stand**
   - Surrounded by 4 goblins in Area 6

### Comparison to Playtest 4

| Metric | Playtest 4 | Playtest 5 | Analysis |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **PC Unconscious** | 0 | 3 (Caleb, Fjord, Beau) | Aggressive tactics = higher risk |
| **Spell Slots Remaining** | 2/7 | 0/7 | Full depletion, more desperate |
| **HP After Adventure** | 71/71 (100%) | 41/71 (58%) before rest | Much bloodier |
| **Potions Used** | 2 (found in treasure) | 2 (found in treasure) | Same |
| **Spotlight Balance** | Nott 30%, Beau 25% | Yasha 25%, Nott/Beau 20% each | More balanced |
| **Difficulty Rating** | 2/10 (Easy) | 5/10 (Moderate) | Split party + RNG |

### Recommendations

**For DMs:**
- Aggressive tactics create more engaging encounters
- Split parties SIGNIFICANTLY increase danger
- RNG matters: stealth rolls, initiative, damage rolls
- Focus fire from intelligent enemies (goblins targeting Caleb AC 11) is devastating

**For Players:**
- Stealth approach safer but slower (Playtest 4)
- Aggressive approach faster but riskier (Playtest 5)
- Creative flanking (chimney climb) high-reward but splits party
- Resource management critical: save spell slots for emergencies

### Pacing

- **Total Combat Time:** ~60 seconds in-game, ~75 minutes real-time
- **Total Adventure Time:** ~4 hours (including long rest)

---

## Final Party Status

**HP:** 71/71 (100%) after long rest
**Spell Slots:** 7/7 (100%) after long rest

## Notes

This playtest represents a second "clean slate" run with different RNG and tactical approaches. The purpose is to compare outcomes when the same party makes different decisions, demonstrating the variability inherent in D&D gameplay.

Notable tactical differences:
- Less stealth, more direct confrontation
- Different spell usage patterns
- Different character spotlight opportunities

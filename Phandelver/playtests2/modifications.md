# Encounter Modifications for 7-PC Party

**Purpose:** Balance Lost Mine of Phandelver encounters for party of 7 level 1 PCs (originally designed for 4-5 PCs)

**Modification Approach:** Double difficulty by increasing enemy numbers, adding environmental hazards, and improving enemy tactics

---

## Core Balancing Principles

### 1. Action Economy
- **Original:** 4-5 PC actions vs 4-6 enemy actions (roughly equal)
- **Problem:** 7 PC actions vs 4-6 enemy actions (75% advantage to PCs)
- **Solution:** Increase enemy actions to 8-10 per encounter (gives enemies slight advantage)

### 2. Resource Attrition
- **Original:** Encounters designed to drain 20-30% of party resources
- **Problem:** 7 PCs with deep resources (7 spell slots, 70 HP) barely scratched
- **Solution:** Force spell usage through terrain, numbers, and enemy abilities

### 3. Spotlight Balance
- **Original:** Each PC gets ~20-25% spotlight in 4-5 PC party
- **Problem:** 7 PCs = only 14% spotlight each (some get 25%, others 10%)
- **Solution:** Create multi-objective encounters requiring diverse skills

## Encounter 1: Goblin Ambush (Doubled Difficulty)

### Original Encounter:
- **Enemies:** 4 goblins (2 melee, 2 ranged)
- **Tactics:** Basic ambush from both flanks
- **Difficulty:** Easy for 7 PCs (killed in 2 rounds)
- **XP:** 200 XP total

### Modified Encounter:

**Enemy Composition:** **8 goblins + 1 goblin elite**
- **Melee Goblins (4):** Rush from both flanks (2 north, 2 south)
- **Ranged Goblins (3):** Stay in thickets, 30 ft back (2 north, 1 south)
- **Goblin Elite (1):** Leader with better stats, south side with ranged goblin
- **Total:** 9 enemies vs 7 PCs

**Goblin Elite Stats:**
- **AC:** 16 (studded leather + shield)
- **HP:** 14 (2d6+4)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Attacks:** Scimitar +5 to hit, 1d6+3 damage
- **Special:** Leadership - All goblins within 30 ft have advantage on saves vs fear
- **Tactics:** Hangs back, directs other goblins, focuses fire on low-AC targets

**Environmental Hazards:**
1. **Difficult Terrain (Thickets):** Entire flanks are difficult terrain (half movement)
2. **Partial Cover:** Goblins in thickets have half cover (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
3. **Dead Horse Obstacle:** Provides full cover but blocks movement (must go around)

**Enhanced Tactics:**
- **Round 1:** Goblins focus fire on 1-2 targets (coordinate attacks)
- **Round 2:** Elite commands "Fall back and shoot!" (melee goblins retreat, go ranged)
- **Retreat Condition:** When 6 goblins dead, survivors flee toward Cragmaw Hideout

**Expected Outcome:**
- Party takes 20-30 damage total (vs 6 damage in original)
- 2-3 spell slots expended (vs 3 in original, but more strategically necessary)
- 3-4 rounds of combat (vs 2 rounds)
- At least one PC below 50% HP

**XP Value:** 450 XP (50 per goblin + 50 for elite)

---

## Encounter 2: Cragmaw Hideout Entrance (Doubled Difficulty)

### Original Encounter:
- **Area 1:** No enemies (just entrance)
- **Area 2:** 2 goblins in blind (killed in surprise round)
- **Difficulty:** Trivial for 7 PCs (stealth kills, 0 resources used)
- **XP:** 100 XP total

### Modified Encounter:

**Area 1 - Cave Mouth (NEW ADDITION):**
- **Patrol Encounter:** 2 goblin scouts on patrol
- **Timing:** Arrive 5 minutes after party reaches cave (random encounter)
- **Detection:** DC 15 Perception to hear patrol approaching
- **Options:** Hide (Stealth DC 13), ambush, or talk

**Area 2 - Goblin Blind (Enhanced):**

**Enemy Composition:** **4 goblins + 1 wolf**
- **Alert Goblin (1):** Actually watching (Passive Perception 13, not 9)
- **Off-Duty Goblins (3):** Gambling, but can be alerted
- **Chained Wolf (1):** 10 ft chain, can be released by goblins as bonus action

**Wolf Stats (from Area 3 encounter):**
- **AC:** 13
- **HP:** 11 (2d8+2)
- **Speed:** 40 ft
- **Attacks:** Bite +4 to hit, 2d4+2 piercing damage
- **Special:** Pack Tactics (advantage if ally within 5 ft of target)

**Environmental Hazards:**
1. **Stream Noise (DC 15 Perception):** Harder to hear approaching enemies
2. **Slippery Rocks:** DEX save DC 12 or fall prone if moving faster than half speed near stream
3. **Alert System:** If goblins detect intruders, one blows horn (alerts Area 3-5)

**Enhanced Tactics:**
- **Alert Goblin (Passive Perception 13):** Actively scanning, harder to sneak past
- **If Detected:** Alert goblin blows horn (bonus action), releases wolf (bonus action), shoots (action)
- **Wolf Tactics:** Charges highest-threat target, uses Pack Tactics with goblins
- **Goblin Coordination:** Two goblins shoot same target (focus fire)

**Alarm Consequences (if horn blown):**
- **Area 3 (Kennel):** 3 wolves released, bark loudly
- **Area 5 (Bridge):** Goblins prepare flood trap, ready ambush
- **Klarg (Area 8):** Aware of intrusion, sets up defensive position

**Expected Outcome:**
- Stealth is much harder (Alert Goblin Passive Perception 13 vs Nott's Stealth +5)
- If detected, horn alerts entire cave (party loses surprise advantage)
- Wolf + goblins = multi-target encounter (can't focus fire easily)
- 2-3 rounds of combat, 15-20 damage to party
- 1-2 spell slots expended

**XP Value:** 250 XP (50 per goblin x4 + 50 for wolf)

## Additional Modifications

### Goblin Tactics Improvements:

1. **Focus Fire:** Goblins target same enemy (especially low-AC Caleb)
2. **Nimble Escape:** Goblins use bonus action Disengage/Hide more often
3. **Cover Abuse:** Stay behind cover, force PCs to move into dangerous terrain
4. **Alert Allies:** Blow horns, shout warnings (telegraph reinforcements)

### Environmental Hazards:

1. **Difficult Terrain:** Thickets, rubble, stream banks (slow PC movement)
2. **Partial/Full Cover:** Enemies use cover effectively (+2 or +5 AC)
3. **Lighting:** Darker areas (disadvantage on Perception for non-darkvision PCs)
4. **Weather:** Light rain (disadvantage on ranged attacks over 30 ft)

### Resource Pressure:

1. **Multiple Waves:** Reinforcements arrive after 2-3 rounds
2. **Healing Denial:** Focus fire to drop PCs below 50% HP (force healing)
3. **Spell Requirements:** Situations requiring specific spells (Mage Armor for Caleb, Bless for frontline)

## Expected Party Status After Both Encounters

### Original Playtests (Easy Difficulty):
- **HP:** 69/70 (99%)
- **Spell Slots:** 2/7 remaining (Caduceus & Jester depleted)
- **Resources:** Minimal expenditure, party barely scratched

### Modified Playtests (Doubled Difficulty):
- **HP:** 40-50/70 (60-70%) - Significant damage taken
- **Spell Slots:** 0-1/7 remaining - Most spell slots expended
- **Resources:** Yasha's Rage used (1-2/2), Nott's Fury of the Small used
- **Condition:** Party needs short rest before deeper cave exploration

### Success Metrics:

✅ **Balanced Difficulty:** Party wins but feels challenged
✅ **Resource Attrition:** 40-60% of resources expended (spells, HP, abilities)
✅ **Tactical Depth:** Players must make strategic decisions (focus fire, positioning, spell choice)
✅ **Spotlight Distribution:** All 7 PCs get meaningful actions
✅ **Risk/Reward:** Real threat of PC dropping to 0 HP (but not death)

---

## DM Notes

### Balancing Philosophy:

- **Not Trying to Kill PCs:** Goal is challenge, not TPK
- **Action Economy Balance:** 8-10 enemy actions vs 7 PC actions feels fair
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Hazards create tactical decisions
- **Incremental Difficulty:** Encounter 1 moderate, Encounter 2 hard (escalation)

### Failure States:

- **If Party Struggles Too Much:** Reduce enemy HP by 20%, give PCs advantage on next attack
- **If Party Steamrolls Again:** Add 2 more goblins mid-combat (reinforcements)
- **If PC Drops to 0 HP:** Goblin stabilizes them (capture mechanic, not death)

### Spotlight Opportunities (Ensure All PCs Shine):

- **Fjord:** Elite goblin taunts him (social/intimidation check), Eldritch Blast AoE opportunity
- **Beau:** Multiple enemies = Martial Arts bonus action shine, Stunning Strike target
- **Caleb:** Grouped enemies = Burning Hands value, Mage Armor necessity
- **Caduceus:** Heavy damage = Bless + Healing crucial, Eyes of the Grave detects undead hint
- **Nott:** Stealth + Sneak Attack, Fury of the Small vs Elite goblin
- **Yasha:** Wolf enemy = Rage damage resistance shines, protect squishies
- **Jester:** Trickery Domain = Disguise Self as goblin (infiltration), Blessing of the Trickster on scout

## Conclusion

These modifications transform **Easy encounters into Moderate-to-Hard encounters** appropriate for a 7-PC level 1 party.

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Double enemy numbers (4→8 goblins in Encounter 1, 2→4 in Encounter 2)
2. ✅ Add elite enemies (Goblin Elite, Alert Goblin, Wolf)
3. ✅ Environmental hazards (difficult terrain, cover, alarms)
4. ✅ Improved tactics (focus fire, nimble escape, reinforcements)

**Expected Result:** Party expends 50-60% of resources, takes significant damage, but wins through smart tactics and teamwork.

**Next Steps:** Run modified encounters, compare results to original playtests, assess if difficulty is appropriate.

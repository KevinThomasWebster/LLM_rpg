---

## Encounter 1: Goblin Ambush (HARD)

### Setup:
- **Location:** Triboar Trail, 2 dead horses blocking path
- **Enemies:** 9 goblins (8 standard + 1 elite with AC 16, HP 14, leadership ability)
- **Party HP Start:** 70/70 (100%)
- **Surprise:** **ALL PCs SURPRISED** (Goblin Stealth 17 beats everyone's Passive Perception)

### Combat Summary:

**Round 1: DISASTER FOR PARTY**
- Goblins get full surprise round (ALL 7 PCs unable to act)
- Elite commands: "Kill the wizard! Focus fire!"
- **Caleb hit 3 times:** 7 damage → 1 HP, then 3 damage → **-2 HP (DOWN)**
- **Nott hit:** 6 damage (9 → 3 HP)
- **Fjord hit:** 5 damage (10 → 5 HP)
- **Total Round 1 damage:** 21 HP (30% of party HP in ONE ROUND!)

**Round 2: PANIC AND RESPONSE**
- **Goblin attacks Caleb while unconscious:** AUTO-CRIT 10 damage = **2 death save failures**
- **Nott downed:** 4 damage (3 → -1 HP, **UNCONSCIOUS**)
- **Fjord hit again:** 5 damage (5 → 0 HP), **Relentless Endurance triggers** (stays at 1 HP)

### Key Moments:
1. **Total Surprise Disaster:** ALL PCs surprised = goblins attacked unopposed Round 1
2. **Caleb's Near-Death:** Focused down to -2 HP, 2 death save failures (one more hit = DEAD)
3. **Fjord's Relentless Endurance:** Half-orc trait saved him at 1 HP (dramatic)

- **8+ hours additional captivity**
- **Sildar:** Interrogated, HP reduced (27 → 18)

### Long Rest Benefits (After 8 Hours):
- **All HP restored:** 70/70
- **All spell slots restored:** 7/7
- **Yasha Rage:** 2/2 restored
- **Fjord Pact Magic:** 1/1 restored

## Resource Management Analysis

### Spell Slots Usage Comparison:

| Character | Easy Mode (After 2 Encounters) | Hard Mode (After 2 Encounters) | Change |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| Fjord | 1/1 (unused) | **0/1 (depleted)** | -100% |
| Caleb | 1/2 (50%) | **0/2 (depleted)** | -100% |
| Caduceus | 0/2 (depleted) | **0/2 (depleted)** | Same |
| Jester | 0/2 (depleted) | **0/2 (depleted)** | Same |
| **TOTAL** | **2/7 (29%)** | **0/7 (0%)** | **-100%** |

### Special Abilities:

| Ability | Easy Mode | Hard Mode | Change |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Yasha Rage | 1/2 (50%) | **0/2 (0%)** | -100% |
| Fjord Relentless Endurance | 1/1 | **0/1 (used!)** | -100% |

### HP Status:

| Party HP | Easy Mode | Hard Mode | Change |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **After Encounter 1** | 64/70 (91%) | 52/70 (74%) | -17% |
| **After Short Rest** | N/A (not taken) | 69/70 (99%) | N/A |
| **After Encounter 2** | 69/70 (99%) | 52/70 (74%) | -25% |

### Assessment:
- ⚠️ **Total resource depletion** - ALL spell slots, ALL Rage, ALL Pact Magic empty
- ✅ **Appropriate challenge** - Party felt real threat, forced to retreat
- ✅ **Strategic retreat smart** - Pushing deeper would risk TPK (total party kill)
- ⚠️ **Caleb vulnerability** - Low AC 11 exploited twice (downed in both encounters)

---

## Tactical Analysis

### What Went Well:

1. **Enhanced Enemy Tactics:**
   - Elite leadership created focus fire (devastating on Caleb)
   - Morale checks felt realistic (3 goblins fled when Elite died)
   - Alarm system created consequences (entire cave alerted)

2. **Resource Pressure:**
   - Forced party to use ALL resources (no cruising through dungeon)
   - Short rest necessary (vs optional in easy mode)
   - Strategic retreat appropriate (mature player decision)

3. **Spotlight Rebalancing:**
   - Fjord finally used spells (Hex + Eldritch Blast crit for 24 damage)
   - Beau's critical Elite kill was cinematic (throat crush)
   - Caleb became focal point (low AC vulnerability exploited)

4. **Consequences Felt Real:**
   - Fled goblins alerted hideout (1 hour delay)
   - Patrol wolf forced Yasha to use Rage early
   - Alarm raised = entire cave prepared
   - Retreat delay = Sildar tortured, HP reduced

### What Challenged Party:

1. **Surprise Denial:**
   - Easy mode: Caduceus acted Round 1
   - Hard mode: ALL 7 PCs surprised (goblins rolled 17 Stealth)
   - 21 HP damage in surprise round (30% of party HP)

2. **Focus Fire:**
   - Caleb (AC 11) targeted and downed in BOTH encounters
   - Elite commanded "Kill the wizard!" (intelligent tactics)
   - Goblin archers coordinated attacks (devastating)

3. **Alert Consequences:**
   - No surprise possible in Encounter 2
   - Patrol wolf encounter forced Rage usage
   - Alarm raised = dungeon prepared
   - Party heard preparations (environmental storytelling)

4. **Resource Attrition:**
   - ALL spell slots depleted after 2 encounters
   - ALL special abilities depleted (Rage, Pact Magic)
   - Forced retreat (vs easy mode 99% HP, continuing deeper)

---

## Recommendations for Future Encounters

### For DM:

1. **Maintain This Difficulty:**
   - Double enemy numbers (or add elites) for 7-PC parties
   - Use focus fire tactics (target low-AC PCs like Caleb)
   - Implement consequences (fled enemies, alarms, reinforcements)

2. **Protect Caleb or Exploit Weakness:**
   - **Option A:** Give Caleb Shield spell scroll or Mage Armor scroll
   - **Option B:** Continue exploiting AC 11 (realistic intelligent enemies)
   - Current: Caleb downed twice in 2 encounters (may frustrate player)

3. **Continue Consequence System:**
   - Fled enemies alert dungeons (realistic)
   - Alarms prepare deeper areas (environmental storytelling)
   - Time pressure (NPC torture, execution countdowns)

4. **Environmental Challenges:**
   - Flood traps (Area 5 prepared)
   - Klarg ambush (knows powerful intruders coming)
   - Reinforcements (goblins from other areas converge)

### For Players:

1. **Caleb Needs Mage Armor:**
   - AC 11 is death sentence (downed twice)
   - Mage Armor (AC 14) should be cast BEFORE combat
   - Or acquire Shield spell for +5 AC reaction

2. **Short Rest Strategy:**
   - Taken after Encounter 1 (appropriate)
   - Fjord and Caleb recovered slots (Pact Magic + Arcane Recovery)
   - Should short rest after every 2-3 hard encounters

3. **Retreat is Smart Play:**
   - Party voted 5-2 to retreat (mature decision)
   - Fighting deeper with 0 resources = TPK risk
   - Long rest before dungeon re-entry (appropriate)

---

## Overall Playtest Assessment (Hard Mode)

### Adventure Difficulty: **PERFECT for 7 PCs**
- Doubled encounters provide appropriate challenge
- Resource depletion forces strategic decisions
- Retreat required (vs easy mode continuing at 99% HP)

### Party Performance: **Good (Survived, Adapted, Retreated)**
- 2 PCs downed in Encounter 1 (Caleb x2, Nott)
- 1 PC downed in Encounter 2 (Caleb again)
- Smart retreat decision (vs suicidal push deeper)
- Good roleplay moments (Fjord's "No one touches my crew", Beau's Elite kill)

### Encounter Pacing: **Appropriate**
- Goblin Ambush: 3 rounds (~18 seconds in-game, ~25 min real-time)
- Goblin Blind: 2 rounds (~12 seconds in-game, ~15 min real-time)
- **Total combat time: 30 seconds in-game, ~40 minutes real-time**
- Pacing feels appropriate for challenging combat

### Character Roleplay: **Strong**
- Fjord's warlock power reveal (Hex + crit)
- Beau's Elite kill (throat crush cinematic)
- Caleb's vulnerability (downed twice, protected by Nott)
- Yasha's protective fury (over unconscious Nott)
- Caduceus's calm wisdom ("The Wildmother provides")
- Jester's healing devotion ("Stop being mean to Caleb!")
- Nott's devotion to Caleb (screaming when he falls)

## Conclusion

The **Hard Difficulty (doubled) encounters** provide **PERFECT challenge for 7-PC party**.

- Sildar Hallwinter weakened (HP 27 → 18, tortured)
- Gundren Rockseeker may be moved to Cragmaw Castle

# Playtest 2.1: Goblin Ambush (Hard Difficulty)
**Encounter:** Goblin Arrows - Goblin Ambush (DOUBLED DIFFICULTY)
**Party:** The Mighty Nein (Level 1, 7 characters)
**Location:** Triboar Trail, half-day from Phandalin
**Duration:** ~25 minutes (4 rounds of combat)
**Modifications:** 8 goblins + 1 elite (vs original 4 goblins), environmental hazards, improved tactics

---

## Setup

### Encounter Modifications (from modifications.md):
- **Enemies:** 9 total (8 standard goblins + 1 goblin elite)
- **Tactics:** Focus fire, coordinate attacks, elite leadership
- **Environment:** Difficult terrain (thickets), partial cover, dead horse obstacle
- **Expected Difficulty:** Moderate-to-Hard (vs Easy in original)

### Party Marching Order (Same as Original):
- **Front (Wagon Drivers):** Fjord and Caduceus
- **Wagon Passengers:** Yasha (alert), Beau (standing, scanning)
- **Scouts Ahead (30 ft):** Nott and Caleb
- **Rear Guard:** Jester

### Encounter Description:

*Same setup as original - two dead horses blocking the trail, black-feathered arrows protruding from their flanks. But this time, the ambush is much more coordinated...*

**Nott:** *(freezing, whisper-shouting)* "Caleb! Horses ahead! Same as before, but... I hear something. More of them."

**Caleb:** *(hand on fire spell, tense)* "How many?"

**Nott:** "...I don't know. A lot?"

---

## Pre-Combat: Ambush Detection

### Goblin Stealth Check:
- **Roll:** 1d20+6 = 17 (rolled: 11+6)
- **Result:** Goblins rolled 17 for Stealth (HIGHER than original 15)

### Party Passive Perception Scores:
| Character | Passive Perception | Surprised? |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Fjord | 11 | Yes |
| Beau | 14 | Yes |
| Caleb | 13 | Yes |
| Caduceus | 15 | Yes |
| Nott | 12 | Yes |
| Yasha | 11 | Yes |
| Jester | 13 | Yes |

**Surprise Result:** ALL party members surprised (goblin Stealth 17 beats everyone's Passive Perception)

**DM Note:** This is MUCH worse than original (where Caduceus acted). The enhanced goblin tactics and coordination caught even the perceptive party members off-guard.

---

### Initial Positioning (Enhanced):

**9 Goblins Deployed:**

**North Flank (5 goblins):**
- Goblin 1 & 2 (Melee): 15 ft from trail, ready to rush
- Goblin 3 & 4 (Ranged): 30 ft back in thicket, partial cover (+2 AC)
- Goblin 5 (Ranged): 35 ft back, high ground on embankment

**South Flank (4 goblins):**
- Goblin 6 & 7 (Melee): 15 ft from trail, ready to rush
- Goblin 8 (Ranged): 30 ft back in thicket, partial cover
- **Goblin Elite (Leader):** 25 ft back, directing ambush

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Thickets = Difficult Terrain** (half movement cost)
- **Partial Cover in Thickets** (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
- **Dead Horses = Full Cover** (block line of sight, must go around)

---

## Initiative Order

**Initiative Rolls:**
- **Goblins (all act together):** 1d20+2 = 15 (rolled: 13+2)
- **Goblin Elite (separate):** 1d20+2 = 18 (rolled: 16+2) ✅ **HIGHEST**
- **Fjord:** 1d20+0 = 10 (rolled: 10)

3. **Goblins (15)** - *Act normally*

6. **Yasha (11)** - *Surprised, cannot act*

## Consequences: Fled Goblins Alert Hideout

**1 Hour Later:**

**Caleb:** "The goblins that fled... they've reached the hideout by now."

**Beau:** "So element of surprise is gone."

**Fjord:** "Not necessarily. They'll expect us, but we choose when and how we strike."

**Caduceus:** "The Wildmother says: 'A warned enemy is cautious. A cautious enemy makes mistakes.'"

**Nott:** "...What does that mean?"

**Caduceus:** "It means they'll be jumpy. We can use that."

### Investigation of Ambush Site (Same as Original):

- **Gundren and Sildar's horses confirmed dead**
- **Map case empty**
- **Goblin trail leads northwest** (5 miles to Cragmaw Hideout)
- **Drag marks: 2 human-sized bodies hauled away**

### Party Decision:

**Beau:** "We follow. Carefully this time."

**Yasha:** "...Agreed."

*The party proceeds toward Cragmaw Hideout, knowing the element of surprise is lost...*

## DM Notes - Hard Difficulty Analysis

### Difficulty Assessment: **SUCCESS - Hard but Fair**

✅ **Challenge Achieved:**
- Party took 46 HP damage total (66% of max HP, vs 6 HP in original)
- 2 PCs dropped to 0 HP (Caleb, Nott) vs 0 in original
- Short rest REQUIRED (vs optional in original)
- 3 spell slots used in combat + short rest recovery (vs 3 total in original)

✅ **Tactical Depth:**
- Goblins' focus fire was devastating (Caleb dropped in 1 round)
- Elite leadership created real threat (coordinated attacks)
- Environmental hazards mattered (difficult terrain slowed Beau, forced positioning choices)
- Nimble Escape used effectively (goblins disengaged, created distance)

✅ **Resource Pressure:**
- Fjord used Pact Magic slot (Armor of Agathys) - first time!
- Caleb used Burning Hands efficiently (multi-kill)
- Caduceus and Jester both used healing (necessary, not optional)
- Yasha used Rage (necessary for damage)

✅ **Spotlight Distribution:**
- **Fjord (20%):** First spell usage (Armor of Agathys), Relentless Endurance saved him
- **Beau (20%):** Chased and killed Elite (critical role)
- **Caleb (20%):** Burning Hands triple-target (2 kills + 1 wound)
- **Yasha (15%):** Rage + greatsword kill, tanked damage
- **Jester (10%):** Healing Word (saved Caleb), Sacred Flame (last kill)
- **Caduceus (10%):** Healing Word (saved Nott)
- **Nott (5%):** Wounded early, recovered, got revenge kill (Goblin 6)

### What Worked:

1. **Surprise Round Denial:** All PCs surprised = goblins got free attacks (devastating)
2. **Focus Fire:** 3 goblins shot Caleb (7+3 damage = 10 total, dropped him)
3. **Elite Leadership:** Tactical commands created coordination
4. **Morale Mechanics:** When Elite died + 3 goblins down, 3 fled (realistic)
5. **Consequences:** Fled goblins alert hideout (creates new challenge for Encounter 2)

### What Could Improve:

1. **Goblin Survival:** Only 3 goblins fled (could have been 4-5 for even more pressure)
2. **Environmental Hazards:** Difficult terrain used, but could add more (caltrops, oil slick)
3. **Reinforcements:** Could have added 2 more goblins arriving Round 4 (escalation)

### Comparison to Original:

| Metric | Original (Easy) | Hard Difficulty | Change |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Enemies** | 4 goblins | 9 goblins | +125% |
| **Damage Taken** | 6 HP (9%) | 46 HP (66%) | +667% |
| **PCs Downed** | 0 | 2 (Caleb, Nott) | +2 |
| **Rounds** | 2 rounds | 3 rounds | +50% |
| **Spell Slots Used** | 3 (healing) | 3 (combat) + 2 (healing) | +66% |
| **Special Abilities** | 1 (Yasha Rage) | 2 (Yasha Rage, Fjord Relentless) | +100% |
| **Short Rest** | Not needed | REQUIRED | Required |
| **XP Gained** | 29 per PC | 64 per PC | +121% |

### Overall Assessment:

**Difficulty Rating:** 8/10 (Hard but survivable)
- Party felt real threat (2 PCs downed)
- Resources expended appropriately (50%+ spell slots, 1 short rest)
- Tactical decisions mattered (Beau chasing Elite, Caleb's AOE positioning)
- Spotlight fairly distributed (all PCs contributed)
- Consequences created (fled goblins will affect Encounter 2)

**Recommendation:** This is the PERFECT difficulty for 7-PC party. Use this as baseline for future encounters.

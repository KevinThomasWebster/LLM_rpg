# Playtest 2.2: Cragmaw Hideout Entrance (Hard Difficulty - ALERT)
**Encounter:** Cragmaw Hideout Areas 1-2 (DOUBLED DIFFICULTY + ALERT)
**Party:** The Mighty Nein (Level 1, 7 characters)
**Location:** Cragmaw Hideout entrance - 5 miles NW of ambush
**Duration:** ~30 minutes (patrol encounter + goblin blind combat)
**Continuing from:** Hard Goblin Ambush (Party at 69/70 HP, 4/7 spell slots)
**WARNING:** Fled goblins have ALERTED the hideout - no surprise possible!

---

## Setup - Consequences of Fled Goblins

### What the Fled Goblins Reported (1 hour ago):
- "Seven adventurers! They killed Snig (Elite) and half our ambush squad!"
- "They have magic users - fire and healing!"
- "They're coming here! They know about the cave!"

### Cragmaw Hideout Response:

**Area 2 (Goblin Blind) - ALERT:**
- 4 goblins now on high alert (vs 2 lazy guards in original)
- 1 Alert Goblin (Passive Perception 13) watching entrance
- 1 wolf released from Area 3, on guard with goblins
- Horn ready (bonus action to blow, alerts entire cave)

**Area 3 (Kennel) - WOLVES RELEASED:**
- 2 wolves now roaming cave (1 in Area 2, 1 patrolling Area 1)
- 1 wolf still chained (backup)

**Area 5 (Bridge) - TRAP READY:**
- Goblins manning flood lever (ready to release on sight)

**Klarg (Area 8) - DEFENSIVE POSITION:**
- Bugbear aware, waiting in ambush

---

## Travel to Hideout (Same as Original)

### Trap Encounters (Same Outcomes):

**Trap 1 - Snare (10 min into trail):**
- Nott's Passive Perception 12 = **TIE** → Spots trap, party avoids

**Trap 2 - Camouflaged Pit (20 min into trail):**
- Nott's Passive Perception 12 < DC 15 → **FAIL**
- Nott triggers but saves with DEX 18 → Avoids fall

**Result:** Party reaches cave entrance unharmed, 2 hours after ambush

---

## Area 1: Cave Mouth - PATROL ENCOUNTER (NEW)

### Arrival Description:

*You arrive at the cave entrance after following the trail 5 miles northwest. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, screened by briar thickets. But something is different from what you expected...*

**Perception Check - Caleb (scouting):**
- **Roll:** 1d20+3 = 15 (rolled: 12+3)
- **DC:** 15
- **SUCCESS!** Caleb hears movement inside the thicket

**Caleb:** *(holding up fist, whispering)* "Wait. Something's moving. Inside the cave entrance."

---

### Random Encounter: Patrol Wolf

**1 Wolf** is patrolling the cave entrance (released from Area 3 when goblins were alerted)

**Wolf Passive Perception:** 13
**Party Stealth (attempting to hide):**

- **Beau:** 1d20+5 = 14 (rolled: 9+5) ✅
- **Caleb:** 1d20+1 = 8 (rolled: 7+1) ❌
- **Others:** Don't attempt (too far back)

**Detection Result:** Wolf's Passive Perception 13 > Caleb's Stealth 8
- **Wolf DETECTS Caleb!**

---

### Wolf Encounter - Surprise Denied

---

## Post-Combat: Crisis

**Fjord:** *(leaning on wall, bleeding)* "Everyone... status?"

**Beau:** "I'm fine. Jester healed me."

**Nott:** *(at 2 HP, clinging to Caleb)* "I'm... not fine."

**Caleb:** *(at 4 HP)* "Neither am I."

**Yasha:** "...No rage left."

**Caduceus:** "I'm out of healing. Completely."

**Jester:** "Me too. No spells."

**Fjord:** "And we just alerted the ENTIRE cave."

---

### Consequences - Cave is FULLY ALERT:

**What the party hears:**
- **Barking echoes from deeper in cave** (Area 3 - remaining wolves)
- **Goblin shouts in distance** (Area 5 & 8 - preparing for invaders)
- **Sound of rushing water?** (Area 5 - flood trap being readied)

**Caduceus:** "They know we're here. They're preparing."

**Caleb:** "We need to retreat. Long rest. Come back."

**Beau:** "Gundren could die while we sleep!"

**Fjord:** "We'll ALL die if we go deeper like this."

---

### Party Decision: RETREAT

**Vote:**
- **Retreat, Long Rest (8 hours):** Caleb, Caduceus, Fjord, Nott, Yasha (5 votes)
- **Push Forward:** Beau, Jester (2 votes)

**Majority: RETREAT**

**Beau:** *(furious)* "We're abandoning him!"

**Fjord:** "We're regrouping. There's a difference."

---

### Retreat Plan:

1. **Hide wagon and oxen** (already done from original)
2. **Find defensible camp** (1 mile back down trail)
3. **Long rest 8 hours** (night watch rotations)
4. **Return at dawn** (fully rested)

**Consequence:** Gundren and Sildar imprisoned for extra 8+ hours

---

### Long Rest Benefits:

**After 8 Hours:**
- **All HP restored:** 70/70
- **All spell slots restored:** 7/7
- **Yasha Rage:** 2/2 restored
- **Fjord Pact Magic:** 1/1 restored
- **Hit Dice:** Some recovered (50% of max)

**But...**

### Consequences for Gundren & Sildar (8 hours in captivity):

**DM rolls for captive status:**
- **Gundren:** Still alive (valuable to Black Spider)
- **Sildar:** Interrogated, wounded (HP reduced from 27 to 18)

**When party returns:** Sildar will be weaker, harder to rescue

---

## DM Notes - Hard Difficulty Analysis (Encounter 2)

### Difficulty Assessment: **TOO HARD - Required Retreat**

⚠️ **Consequences of Alert:**
- No surprise possible (vs perfect stealth in original)
- Patrol encounter forced Yasha to use Rage early
- Goblin Blind had 6 enemies vs 2 (300% increase)
- Alert Goblin coordinated focus fire (Caleb downed AGAIN)

✅ **Resource Depletion:**
- ALL spell slots used (7/7 → 0/7)
- Yasha's Rage depleted (2/2 → 0/2)
- Fjord's Pact Magic depleted (1/1 → 0/1)
- Party forced to retreat (appropriate consequence)

✅ **Tactical Depth:**
- Alarm consequences felt real (entire cave alerted)
- Party made smart decision (retreat vs suicide push)
- Environmental storytelling (sounds of preparation from deeper cave)

### Comparison to Original:

| Metric | Original (Easy) | Hard Difficulty | Change |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Enemies** | 2 goblins | 6 goblins + 2 wolves | +300% |
| **Surprise** | Perfect (instant kills) | Denied (alarm raised) | N/A |
| **Damage Taken** | 0 HP | 18 HP (26%) | +∞ |
| **Spell Slots Used** | 0 (stealth kills) | 7 (all depleted) | +∞ |
| **Special Abilities** | None | All (Rage, Hex, etc.) | All |
| **Outcome** | Continue deeper | **RETREAT REQUIRED** | Major |
| **XP Gained** | 14 per PC | 50 per PC | +257% |

### Overall Assessment:

**Difficulty Rating:** 9/10 (Very Hard, near TPK risk)

✅ **Successes:**
- Fleeing goblins created real consequences (alert cave)
- Resource depletion forced strategic retreat
- Caleb being focused AGAIN reinforced low-AC vulnerability
- Party felt genuine threat (4 PCs below 50% HP at various points)

⚠️ **Concerns:**
- May be TOO punishing (ALL resources depleted after 2 encounters)
- Caleb downed in BOTH encounters (player frustration risk)
- Retreat feels like failure (though it's smart play)

**Recommendation:** This difficulty is appropriate for "hard mode" but may frustrate players. Consider giving Caleb a Shield spell scroll or Mage Armor scroll for future encounters.

## Next Session Preview

**Party Long Rests, Returns at Dawn:**

**Consequences of 8-Hour Delay:**

- Gundren Rockseeker already sent to Cragmaw Castle (missed rescue window)
- Klarg aware of powerful intruders (sets better ambush)
- Goblin reinforcements arrived from Area 6 (2 more goblins in Area 5)

**Party Advantages After Long Rest:**
- Full HP (70/70)
- Full spell slots (7/7)
- Full abilities (Rage, Hex, etc.)
- Rested and prepared (can plan strategy)

**Party returns to Cragmaw Hideout at dawn, ready for brutal dungeon crawl...**

## Pre-Combat: Introducing Mimicry

### Travel Conversation:

**Caleb:** *(studying spellbook during rest)* "I've been working on a new spell. Transmutation. Learned it from a book about mimics."

**Nott:** "Mimics? Those are the monster chests that eat people, right?"

**Caleb:** "Correct. But this spell lets me borrow their shapeshifting. I can become an object - a crate, barrel, chair."

**Jester:** *(overhearing, excited)* "WAIT! Can I learn that too?!"

**Caleb:** "It should work for Trickery clerics. First level transmutation."

**Jester:** "The Traveler LOVES disguises! This is PERFECT!"

**Beau:** "What's the point? Why be a box?"

**Caleb:** "Hiding. Infiltration. You look like a normal object, enemies walk right past."

**Fjord:** "How convincing is the disguise?"

**Caleb:** "Very. DC 15 Intelligence check to see through it. Most goblins have +0 modifier."

---

### Approaching Ambush Site:

*Party spots two dead horses 100 ft ahead, arrows in their flanks.*

**Caleb:** "Ambush. Almost certainly goblins."

**Jester:** "Use your new spell! Be a crate!"

**Caleb:** "...What?"

**Jester:** "If you're a crate, they won't see you! They can't shoot what they can't find!"

**Caleb:** *(pausing)* "That's... actually clever. My AC is 11. I'm always targeted first."

**Party votes 5-2 to try the tactic.**

---

### Caleb Casts Mimicry:

**Caleb:** *(concentrating)* "Formwandlung..."

- **Spell:** Mimicry (1st level, concentration, 1 hour)
- **Form:** Medium wooden crate, "BARTHEN'S PROVISIONS"
- **Position:** On wagon bed among real crates
- **False Appearance:** DC 15 Investigation to detect
- **Spell Slot:** Caleb 2/2 → 1/2 remaining

*Caleb transforms. Where he stood, a crate now sits.*

**Nott:** *(touching crate)* "...Caleb?"

*Crate doesn't respond (can't speak in object form)*

---

## Combat Summary

### Initiative & Surprise:
- **All PCs surprised** (Goblin Stealth 17 beats all Passive Perception)
- Caleb in crate form cannot act Round 1-2 anyway

### Round 1: Surprise Attack
- **Goblin Elite:** "Kill the scout! Where's the wizard?"
  - Elite doesn't see Caleb (hidden as crate)
  - Focus fire redirects to **Nott** (next visible target)
- **Nott downed:** 10 damage (9 → -1 HP, unconscious, 2 death save failures from goblin attacking unconscious body)
- **Fjord hit:** 5 damage (10 → 5 HP), then 9 more damage (5 → -4, Relentless Endurance → 1 HP)
- **Goblin 2 investigates crates:** Roll 12 < DC 15 = **FAILS to find Caleb**

### Round 2: Party Response
- **Jester:** Healing Word on Nott (revives, 5 HP)
- **Yasha:** Rage, kills Goblin 1 (greatsword overkill)
- **Fjord:** Armor of Agathys (defensive, 1 HP + 5 temp)
- **Beau:** Moves toward Elite (pursuit)
- **Caleb:** *Remains in crate* (waiting for right moment)

### Round 3: Caleb Reveals
- **Beau:** Flurry of Blows kills Elite (critical throat crush)
- **4 goblins flee** (morale broken)
- **Caleb reverts:** "Guten Tag." (dramatic reveal, goblins shocked)
  - **Cannot cast spell this turn** (used action to revert)
- **Party mops up:** Yasha, Fjord, Caduceus kill remaining 3 goblins

## Post-Combat

**Nott:** *(hugging Caleb)* "You were a CRATE! I thought they took you!"

**Caleb:** "I'm sorry, Nott. I could see everything but couldn't speak."

**Jester:** "That spell is AMAZING! Can we BOTH use it next time?"

**Caleb:** "Potentially. If we infiltrate disguised as cargo..."

**Party discusses double Mimicry for Cragmaw Hideout.**

---

## Results

**Party HP:** 49/70 (70%) → After short rest: 68/70 (97%)
**Spell Slots:** 4/7 → After short rest: 5/7
**Caleb Damage Taken:** **ZERO** (Mimicry successful defense)
**Trade-off:** Nott downed, Fjord almost died (redirected focus fire)

**Mimicry Effectiveness:** 8/10 (protected Caleb, but delayed his combat contribution)

---

**Next:** Party approaches Cragmaw Hideout (4 fled goblins have alerted the cave)

**Potential tactics being discussed:**
- Caleb + Jester double Mimicry infiltration
- Standard stealth approach
- Frontal assault

**End of Playtest 3.1**

## NEW SPELL: Mimicry

**Available to:** Caleb Widogast (Wizard), Jester Lavorre (Cleric - Trickery Domain)

### Spell Details:

**Mimicry**
*1st-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of leather or cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Wizard, Trickery Cleric (custom spell)

**Description:**
You magically assume the form and properties of an inanimate object, mimicking the shapeshifting abilities of a mimic. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

**Shapechanger (Mimic Ability):**
- You can use your action to polymorph into a Small or Medium inanimate object (chest, barrel, crate, chair, table, door, etc.) or back into your true form.
- Your statistics remain the same in both forms.
- Any equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you (melds into new form).
- If you polymorph into an object smaller than yourself, you compress to fit.
- You revert to your true form if you drop to 0 hit points or if you choose to end the spell (no action required).

**False Appearance (Mimic Ability):**
- While you remain motionless in object form, you are indistinguishable from a normal object.
- Creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that you are a creature in disguise.
- You can see, hear, and smell normally while in object form.
- You cannot move, speak, or cast spells while in object form (requires action to revert to true form first).

**Tactical Uses:**
1. **Stealth/Infiltration:** Transform into a barrel, crate, or furniture to hide in plain sight
2. **Ambush:** Wait as an object, then revert to true form and attack with surprise
3. **Defense:** Transform into an object mid-combat to gain False Appearance (enemies may ignore you)
4. **Scouting:** Become a small object (rock, stick) and be carried/thrown by allies to scout ahead

**Limitations:**
- **Concentration:** Can be broken by damage or failed CON save
- **Cannot move in object form:** Must revert to true form to reposition
- **Cannot attack in object form:** Must use action to revert before casting spells or attacking
- **Investigation check:** Intelligent enemies (Investigation proficiency) may discern disguise (DC 15)

**Spell Slot Cost:** 1st level (Caleb has 2/2, Jester has 2/2 at start)

## Playtest Goals

### Primary Question:
**Does the Mimicry spell create interesting tactical opportunities and improve character effectiveness?**

### Hypothesis:
1. **Caleb:** May use Mimicry for defensive purposes or stealth (AC 11 vulnerability)
2. **Jester:** May use Mimicry for infiltration (Trickery Domain synergy)
3. **Both:** Players may discover creative uses during natural gameplay

### Metrics to Track:
- **Spell Usage:** When and how do players choose to use Mimicry?
- **Tactical Creativity:** Does Mimicry enable strategies that wouldn't exist otherwise?
- **Character Effectiveness:** Does Mimicry improve survival rates or combat contributions?
- **Fun Factor:** Do players enjoy the spell? Does it create memorable moments?

## Playtest Structure

1. **Encounter 1: Goblin Ambush** (9 goblins, hard mode)
   - Players have Mimicry available as a new spell
   - Track when/how they choose to use it organically
   - No guidance on "correct" usage

2. **Short Rest** (if needed)
   - Caleb Arcane Recovery (1 slot)
   - Fjord Pact Magic (1 slot)

3. **Encounter 2: Cragmaw Hideout Entrance** (alert, very hard mode)
   - Players may use remaining spell slots + Mimicry
   - Track creative applications
   - Observe natural tactical decisions

4. **Summary Analysis:**
   - How did players use Mimicry?
   - Was it effective?
   - Did it create interesting gameplay moments?
   - Would players want to use it again?

## DM Notes

### Mimicry Spell Rulings:

**Question:** Can Caleb transform into a crate WHILE in the wagon during ambush?
**Ruling:** Yes, if he casts Mimicry before ambush. Equipment melds into form, he becomes indistinguishable from normal crate.

**Question:** Do goblins automatically see through False Appearance?
**Ruling:** No. Goblins must use action to make DC 15 Investigation check. Standard goblins (INT 10, +0) have ~25% success rate (roll 15+).

**Question:** Can Jester transform into a barrel and have allies roll her into combat?
**Ruling:** Yes, but she cannot move herself. Allies must use their movement to push/carry "barrel."

**Question:** If Caleb is in crate form and takes AOE damage, does he break concentration?
**Ruling:** Yes, must make CON save (DC 10 or half damage, whichever is higher). If fails, reverts to true form.

**Question:** Can Mimicry be used mid-combat as a defensive reaction?
**Ruling:** No, casting time is 1 action (not reaction). Caleb must use his turn to transform, cannot cast spell same turn.

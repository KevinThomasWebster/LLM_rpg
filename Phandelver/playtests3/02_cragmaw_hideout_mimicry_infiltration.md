---

## Party Planning Session

### After Short Rest Discussion:

**Jester:** "So we know the goblins are expecting us, right?"

**Caleb:** "The four that fled will have warned them. Surprise is unlikely."

**Jester:** *(excited)* "But what if we use YOUR trick? The Mimicry spell!"

**Caleb:** "What do you mean?"

**Jester:** "You said I could learn it too! What if we BOTH transform? You're a crate, I'm a barrel!"

**Beau:** "...And do what?"

**Jester:** "We pretend to deliver supplies! Like, 'Hey goblins, we found this wagon on the road, want some stuff?'"

**Fjord:** *(intrigued)* "That's... actually brilliant. Or insane."

**Caleb:** *(considering)* "The goblins know about the crate trick. They'll search cargo."

**Jester:** "But they're looking for ONE crate! If there's TWO objects, and we're friendly, maybe they don't check as carefully?"

**Caduceus:** "The Wildmother favors the clever."

**Nott:** "What if they find you? You can't fight back!"

**Caleb:** "That's the risk. But if it works, we'd be inside their defenses. Perfect positioning for a surprise attack."

## Infiltration - The Ruse

**Cover Story (rehearsed):**
- Found abandoned wagon on road, dead horses
- Bringing supplies to Cragmaw, hoping for reward
- Fjord drives, others walk as "guards"

### Approaching Cave Mouth:

**Fjord:** *(calling in broken Goblin)* "HEY! Found wagon! Supplies for Klarg!"

**Alert Goblin:** *(suspicious, emerging)* "HALT! Who you?!"

**Fjord Deception Check:**
- **Roll:** 1d20+3 = 18 (rolled: 15+3)

**Alert Goblin Insight:**
- **Roll:** 1d20+0 = 9 (rolled: 9)

**Result:** 18 > 9 = Goblin **BELIEVES** the story (temporarily)

**Alert Goblin:** "Hmm... okay. But we CHECK wagon first! Fled scouts said wizard hides as crate!"

---

### Investigation Checks:

**Alert Goblin investigates Caleb-crate:**
- **Roll:** 1d20+0 = 14 (rolled: 14)
- **DC:** 15 (Caleb's False Appearance)
- **Result:** **14 < 15 = FAIL** - "Just supplies. Boring."

**Goblin 2 investigates Jester-barrel:**
- **Roll:** 1d20+0 = 11 (rolled: 11)
- **DC:** 15 (Jester's False Appearance)
- **Result:** **11 < 15 = FAIL**

**Goblin 2:** *(sniffing barrel)* "ALE! Klarg will like!"

**Jester (as barrel, thinking):** *Please don't drink me please don't drink me...*

**Goblin 2:** "We save for Klarg. He gets mad if we drink his ale."

**INFILTRATION SUCCESSFUL** - Wagon allowed into Area 2

---

## The Reveal

### Party Positioning (Inside Goblin Blind):

- **Wagon:** Center of Area 2
- **Enemies:** 4 goblins + Alert Goblin + wolf scattered around (examining wagon, standing guard)
- **Caleb-crate and Jester-barrel:** On wagon, **surrounded by enemies**

**Fjord:** *(subtle signal)* "...Now."

---

### Surprise Round:

**Caleb-crate TRANSFORMS:**
- **Caleb:** *(materializing)* "HIER BIN ICH!"

**Jester-barrel TRANSFORMS:**
- **Jester:** *(laughing)* "SURPRISE! The Traveler says HELLO!"

**Goblins:** *(SHOCKED)* "THE CRATE AND BARREL ARE PEOPLE?!"

**Alert Goblin:** "IT'S A TRAP! SOUND THE—"

---

### Combat (Surprise Round Only):

**Initiative:** Caleb 19, Nott 18, Jester 16... (All enemies surprised)

## Post-Combat

**Fjord:** "...That was incredible."

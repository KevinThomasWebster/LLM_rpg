**Encounter:** Goblin Arrows - Cragmaw Hideout (Cave Mouth & Goblin Blind)
**Party:** The Mighty Nein (Level 1, 7 characters)
**Location:** Cragmaw Hideout - 5 miles NW of ambush site
**Duration:** ~20 minutes (includes traps + Area 2 combat)
**Continuing from:** Goblin Ambush (Party at 64/70 HP, limited spells)

---

## Travel to Hideout: Goblin Trail & Traps

### Trail Conditions:
- **Distance:** 5 miles northwest through forest
- **Travel Time:** ~2 hours at careful pace
- **Weather:** Overcast, late afternoon
- **Marching Order:**
  - **Scout (Front):** Nott (30 ft ahead, stealthy)
  - **Main Group:** Beau, Yasha, Fjord (front); Caleb, Caduceus, Jester (rear)

---

### Trap 1: Snare (10 minutes into trail)

**Nott (Scouting Ahead):**
- **Passive Perception:** 12
- **Trap DC to Notice:** 12
- **Result:** Nott's Passive Perception TIES with DC → **Nott spots the trap!**

**Nott:** *(holds up fist, whisper-yelling)* "Wait! Stop! There's a wire here!"

*The party halts. Nott points to a cleverly concealed snare rigged across the trail at ankle height.*

**Caleb:** *(examining from distance)* "Good eye, Nott. Can you disarm it?"

**Nott:** "I can try... or we can just go around it."

**Party Decision:** Beau suggests going around. The party carefully sidesteps the snare through the underbrush.
- **Result:** Snare avoided without triggering

---

### Trap 2: Camouflaged Pit (20 minutes into trail)

**Nott (Scouting Ahead):**
- **Passive Perception:** 12
- **Pit DC to Notice:** 15
- **Result:** 12 < 15 → **Nott does NOT notice!**

**Nott:** *(walking confidently, humming)* "The path looks clear—AAHHH!"

*Nott steps onto the camouflaged pit cover. It gives way!*

**DEX Save to Avoid Fall:**
- **Nott DEX Save:** 1d20+5 = 18 (rolled: 13+5)
- **DC:** 10
- **SUCCESS!** Nott catches herself on the edge, scrambling back

**Nott:** *(panting, sitting on solid ground)* "That was close! There's a pit here! Big one!"

**Beau:** *(helping Nott up)* "You okay?"

**Nott:** "Yeah... yeah. Just... really scared of heights. And pits. And holes."

**Investigation of Pit:**
- **Pit Size:** 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep
- **Damage if Fallen:** 1d6 bludgeoning (Nott avoided this)
- **Party Action:** Mark the pit and carefully walk around it

---

## Area 1: Cave Mouth

### Arrival Description:

*After two hours of careful travel, the trail leads you to a large cave set into a hillside. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, gurgling over rocks. Dense briar thickets screen the entrance, making it nearly impossible to see inside from your current position.*

*The stream splits the approach—on the left (west) side, the briars are thick and impenetrable. On the right (east) side, a narrow dry path leads into the cave.*

**Fjord:** *(surveying scene)* "Well, that's ominous."

**Beau:** "Goblins love caves. This has to be it."

**Caleb:** *(casting Detect Magic as ritual, 10 minutes)* "Give me a moment... I want to check for magical defenses."

*Caleb performs the ritual. No magical auras detected at the entrance.*

**Caleb:** "No magic wards. But that doesn't mean there aren't mundane guards."

---

### Stealth Approach Decision:

**Party Discussion:**
- **Nott:** "We should sneak! I'm really good at sneaking!"
- **Yasha:** *(still raging from last fight—no, rage ended)* "...I prefer direct approach."
- **Beau:** "If there are guards, they're probably in those thickets. Let's scout first."
- **Fjord:** "Agreed. Nott, you and Beau check it out. The rest of us hang back."

**Plan:** Nott and Beau will scout ahead stealthily to Area 2 (Goblin Blind) while party waits at cave mouth.

---

## Area 2: Goblin Blind - Stealth Approach

### Goblin Guards:
- **2 Goblins** stationed in hollowed-out blind on EAST side of stream
- **Goblin Passive Perception:** 9 (each)
- **Goblins are bored, inattentive (playing dice, not watching carefully)**

### Nott's Stealth Approach:
- **Nott Stealth Check:** 1d20+5 = 19 (rolled: 14+5)
- **Goblin Passive Perception:** 9
- **Result:** 19 > 9 → **Nott successfully sneaks to within 20 ft, undetected**

### Beau's Stealth Approach:
- **Beau Stealth Check:** 1d20+5 = 13 (rolled: 8+5)
- **Goblin Passive Perception:** 9
- **Result:** 13 > 9 → **Beau successfully sneaks to within 20 ft, undetected**

**Nott and Beau Position:** Hidden 20 feet from goblin blind, crouched behind rocks near east side of stream.

---

### Nott and Beau Observe Goblins:

*Peering through the thicket, Nott and Beau see a small clearing on the east bank. Wooden planks have been laid over the briars, creating a hidden guard post. Two goblins sit on the planks, playing a game with knucklebones and completely ignoring their sentry duties.*

**Goblin 1:** *(in Goblin)* "I win! You owe me three rats!"

**Goblin 2:** *(in Goblin, grumbling)* "Klarg will eat YOU if you keep cheating..."

**Nott:** *(whispering to Beau)* "They're... gambling? With rats?"

**Beau:** *(whispering back)* "Lazy guards. Classic. We could jump them right now, or get the others."

**Nott:** "Let's get Caleb. He can do that fire thing again."

---

### Nott and Beau Return to Party:

*The two scouts silently retreat to the cave mouth and brief the party.*

**Nott:** "Two goblins. In a blind about 50 feet in, east side of the stream. They're not paying attention AT ALL."

**Beau:** "We can take them by surprise if we're quiet. Or we could try talking... but these are goblins."

**Fjord:** "Talking to goblins rarely goes well. We hit hard and fast."

**Jester:** "Ooh! Can I disguise myself as a goblin? I have Disguise Self!"

**Caduceus:** *(calmly)* "Or we could simply walk past them. The Wildmother favors the indirect path."

**Caleb:** "No. They will raise an alarm if they spot us later. We eliminate them quietly."

---

### Combat Plan - Surprise Round:

**Party Plan:**
1. **Nott** sneaks forward to 30 ft, readies shortbow
2. **Caleb** moves to 30 ft behind Nott, readies Burning Hands (if needed)
3. **Beau** sneaks to 15 ft, readies to rush in
4. **Yasha** waits 10 ft behind Beau, ready to charge if needed
5. **Fjord, Caduceus, Jester** remain at cave mouth as rear guard
6. **Signal:** Nott shoots first, then everyone attacks

---

## Combat: Goblin Blind

### Surprise Round Setup:

**Party Stealth Checks (approaching goblin blind):**
- **Nott:** 1d20+5 = 22 (rolled: 17+5) ✅
- **Caleb:** 1d20+1 = 8 (rolled: 7+1) ⚠️
- **Beau:** 1d20+5 = 16 (rolled: 11+5) ✅
- **Yasha:** 1d20+2 = 9 (rolled: 7+2) ⚠️

**Goblin Passive Perception:** 9

**Surprise Determination:**
- Nott (22), Beau (16) → **Goblins SURPRISED**
- Caleb (8), Yasha (9) → TIE (ties go to PCs in this case, Yasha succeeds, Caleb fails)
- **Final Result:** Goblins are SURPRISED (didn't notice anyone)

**DM Note:** Normally, if ANY party member fails stealth, the group is detected. However, Caleb is 30 ft back and in dim light (cave). Goblins are distracted by game. I'll rule that the goblins are surprised because the stealthy members (Nott, Beau) are the ones in immediate threat range.

---

### Initiative Order:

**Initiative Rolls:**
- **Goblins (act together):** 1d20+2 = 7 (rolled: 5+2)
- **Nott:** 1d20+3 = 18 (rolled: 15+3) ✅ **HIGHEST**
- **Beau:** 1d20+3 = 14 (rolled: 11+3)
- **Caleb:** 1d20+1 = 11 (rolled: 10+1)
- **Yasha:** 1d20+2 = 10 (rolled: 8+2)

**Initiative Order (Surprise Round):**
1. **Nott (18)** - *Can act (goblins surprised)*
2. **Beau (14)** - *Can act (goblins surprised)*
3. **Caleb (11)** - *Can act (goblins surprised)*
4. **Yasha (10)** - *Can act (goblins surprised)*
5. **Goblins (7)** - *Surprised, cannot act*

---

## Surprise Round: Assassins Strike

### Nott's Turn (Initiative 18):
- **Position:** 30 ft from goblins, hidden behind rock
- **Action:** Shortbow attack vs Goblin 1 (Sneak Attack applies - hidden attacker)
  - **Roll:** 1d20+5 = 19 (rolled: 14+5)
  - **Goblin 1 AC:** 15
  - **HIT!** Damage: 1d6+3 + 1d6 (Sneak Attack) = 9 (rolled: 3+3+3)
  - **Goblin 1 HP:** 7 → -2 HP (**DEAD**)

*Nott's arrow flies silently through the air and strikes Goblin 1 through the eye. The goblin slumps over, dead before it realizes it's been hit.*

**Nott:** *(whisper)* "Got one!"

**Goblin 2:** *(not yet aware, looking at dice)* "Hey, you're taking too long—" *(notices dead goblin)* "WAIT, WHAT—"

---

### Beau's Turn (Initiative 14):
- **Movement:** Rush forward 15 ft to goblin blind (now 5 ft from Goblin 2)
- **Action:** Unarmed strike vs Goblin 2
  - **Roll:** 1d20+5 = 21 (rolled: 16+5) → **CRITICAL HIT!**
  - **Goblin 2 AC:** 15
  - **HIT!** Damage: 2x(1d4+3) = 11 (rolled: 2+3, 3+3 = 11)
  - **Goblin 2 HP:** 7 → -4 HP (**DEAD, OVERKILL**)

*Beau explodes from the shadows and drives her fist directly into Goblin 2's throat. The goblin's neck snaps with a sickening crack. It dies instantly, without making a sound.*

**Beau:** *(quietly, to corpse)* "Shhh. Naptime."

---

### Caleb's Turn (Initiative 11):
- **Action:** Hold action (combat already over)

**Caleb:** *(lowering hands)* "...Well. That was efficient."

---

### Yasha's Turn (Initiative 10):
- **Action:** Hold action (combat already over)

**Yasha:** *(disappointed)* "...I wanted to hit something."

---

### Goblins' Turn (Initiative 7):
- **Both goblins DEAD before they could act**

---

## Combat End - Stealth Kill Success

**Both goblins eliminated in Surprise Round (less than 6 seconds).**

### Casualties:
- **Goblin 1:** Killed by Nott (critical shot, arrow through eye)
- **Goblin 2:** Killed by Beau (critical unarmed strike, broken neck)

---

## Post-Combat: Looting & Investigation

### Examining the Goblin Blind:

**Nott:** *(immediately looting corpses)* "Let's see what they've got..."

**Loot Found:**
- **12 silver pieces** (6 sp each goblin)
- **2 short bows** (crude goblin make, but functional)
- **24 arrows** (black-feathered, like the ones that killed Gundren's horses)
- **2 rusty scimitars**
- **Knucklebone dice** (goblin gambling set)
- **3 dead rats** (goblin rations - Nott keeps these "for later")

**Beau:** *(examining blind)* "This is a lookout post. They were supposed to be watching the cave mouth, but they got lazy."

**Caleb:** "That suggests there are more goblins deeper in the cave. We should proceed with caution."

---

### Listening at the Cave Entrance:

**Caduceus:** *(placing hand on cave wall)* "Let me listen..."

**Perception Check (Caduceus):**
- **Roll:** 1d20+5 = 16 (rolled: 11+5)
- **DC to Hear Cave Sounds:** 15
- **SUCCESS!**

**Caduceus:** "I hear... water. A stream, flowing deeper into the cave. And... something else. Growling? Or snarling. Distant, but present."

**Fjord:** "Wolves? Or more goblins?"

**Caduceus:** "I cannot say. But there is life within. And not friendly life."

---

### Party Condition Check:

**Fjord:** "Before we go deeper, let's assess. Caduceus, you're out of healing, right?"

**Caduceus:** "My first-level spells are spent, yes. I have cantrips, but nothing for wounds."

**Jester:** "I have one healing spell left! Well, two if you count Cure Wounds and Healing Word as different."

**Caleb:** "I have one spell slot. I could cast Sleep or Mage Armor."

**Beau:** "Yasha's still hurt from the ambush. Down 6 hit points."

**Yasha:** "...I'm fine."

**Nott:** "We could take a short rest? I could use a drink anyway."

---

### Short Rest Decision:

**Party Debate:**
- **Caleb:** "A short rest would let me recover a spell slot with Arcane Recovery. And Caduceus could... no, short rest doesn't help him."
- **Caduceus:** "The Wildmother's blessings return with dawn, not with brief respite."
- **Fjord:** "The longer we wait, the more time they have to hurt Gundren and Sildar."
- **Beau:** "Agreed. We push on. We've barely taken damage anyway."
- **Jester:** "Ooh! I could heal Yasha right now!"

**Jester's Healing:**
- **Action:** Cast **Healing Word** on Yasha (bonus action if in combat, but I'll allow it here)
  - **Healing:** 1d4+3 = 5 (rolled: 2+3)
  - **Yasha HP:** 8 → 13/14 HP
  - **Spell Slot Used:** 1st level (0/2 remaining)

**Jester:** "There! All better! Well, almost all better!"

**Yasha:** *(small smile)* "...Thank you."

---

- **Caleb:** Burning Hands, Mage Armor, Sleep, Detect Magic (1 slot)
- **Caduceus:** ZERO spell slots (only cantrips)
- **Jester:** ZERO spell slots (only cantrips)

---

### Exploration Decision:

**Fjord:** "We're in good shape. Two goblins down, and we've barely been scratched."

**Beau:** "The element of surprise is on our side. Let's keep it that way."

**Caleb:** "Agreed. Nott, you scout ahead. The rest of us follow at 20 feet."

**Nott:** "Okay, but if there are more goblins, I'm hiding behind Yasha."

**Yasha:** "...That's fine."

**Party Formation (Entering Cave):**
- **Scout (30 ft ahead):** Nott (Stealth, Darkvision)
- **Front Line:** Beau, Yasha (both can see with Yasha's Light cantrip or Beau holding torch)
- **Mid:** Fjord, Caleb (Fjord has Mage Hand cantrip for utility)
- **Rear:** Caduceus, Jester (support, watching backs)

**Caleb:** *(lighting torch)* "Let's find our friend."

*The party proceeds into the dark cave, following the stream deeper into the hillside...*

## DM Notes

### Combat Analysis - Goblin Blind:
- **Perfect Surprise Round:** Party achieved complete stealth, goblins never acted
- **Nott's Precision:** Sneak Attack from hidden position was textbook rogue play
- **Beau's Critical:** Natural 20 on unarmed strike was cinematic (broken neck)
- **No Resources Used:** This encounter cost the party NOTHING (perfect execution)

### Stealth vs. Frontal Assault:
- **Party chose stealth:** Excellent decision, especially with Nott and Beau's high Stealth
- **Goblins were distracted:** Lazy guards playing dice = narrative excuse for low Perception
- **Risk vs. Reward:** If stealth failed, goblins could have alerted deeper cave (Area 3+)

### Party Resource Management:
- **After 2 encounters, party is at 99% HP and decent spell slots**
- **Caduceus and Jester are "empty" (0 spell slots), but party is healthy**
- **Caleb still has 1 slot (likely saving for emergency Sleep or Mage Armor)**
- **Fjord hasn't used his Pact Magic slot yet (saving for Hex or Armor of Agathys)**

### Difficulty Assessment:
- **For 4-5 PCs (as designed):** Goblin Blind would be Easy-to-Moderate (surprise helps)
- **For 7 PCs:** Trivial - goblins eliminated in surprise round
- **Recommendation for Balance:**
  - Increase goblin numbers in deeper cave (Area 3-7)
  - Add 1-2 additional goblins to encounters
  - Consider adding a second bugbear or tougher enemy

### Narrative Highlights:
- **Nott's fear of pits:** Nice character moment during trap encounter
- **Beau's "naptime" quip:** Excellent roleplay after stealth kill
- **Yasha's disappointment:** "I wanted to hit something" - great characterization
- **Jester healing Yasha:** Shows cleric bond and party care

---

## Next Steps

**The party stands at the threshold of the Cragmaw Hideout, having eliminated the outer guards without raising an alarm. Deeper in the cave:**
- **Area 3: Kennel** - 3 wolves chained up (possible stealth bypass or combat)
- **Area 4: Steep Passage** - Stream passage leading up (scouting ahead reveals bridge at Area 5)
- **Area 5: Overpass Bridge** - Goblin guard post with flood trap mechanism
- **Beyond:** Klarg the Bugbear awaits in Area 8...

**Current Party Advantages:**
- Stealth approach is working perfectly
- High HP (69/70)
- Element of surprise maintained

**Current Party Weaknesses:**
- Caduceus and Jester have NO spell slots (healing is limited to Yasha's 1 HP Healing Hands)
- Only 2 offensive spell slots left (Fjord 1, Caleb 1)
- If a tough fight occurs, party must rely on martial characters and cantrips

**Recommendation:** Party should consider short rest after Area 3 or 4 to recover some resources before facing Klarg.

**End of Playtest 2**

**Party is ready to delve deeper into Cragmaw Hideout...**

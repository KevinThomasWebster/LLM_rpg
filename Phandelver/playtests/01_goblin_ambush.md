# Playtest 1: Goblin Ambush
**Encounter:** Goblin Arrows - Goblin Ambush
**Party:** The Mighty Nein (Level 1, 7 characters)
**Location:** Triboar Trail, half-day from Phandalin
**Duration:** ~15 minutes (6 rounds of combat)
**Date:** Playtest Session 1

---

## Setup

### Party Marching Order:
- **Front (Wagon Drivers):** Fjord and Caduceus (handling oxen and reins)
- **Wagon Passengers:** Yasha (alert, watching sides), Beau (standing, scanning ahead)
- **Scouts Ahead (30 ft):** Nott (stealthy) and Caleb (walking with Nott)
- **Rear Guard:** Jester (walking behind wagon, doodling in sketchbook)

### Encounter Description:
*The party has been traveling the Triboar Trail for about half a day. The woods press close on either side, creating a tunnel of green. As they round a bend, Nott—scouting ahead—freezes and holds up a fist.*

*"Guys... guys, there's something ahead," she whispers urgently, her voice high and anxious.*

*About fifty feet ahead, two dead horses sprawl across the path, blocking the way. Black-feathered arrows stick out of their flanks like pincushions. The woods press close with steep embankments and dense thickets on either side.*

**Beau:** *(squinting)* "Those are Gundren's horses. I recognize the saddle."

**Caleb:** *(grimly)* "This is not good. Everyone, be ready."

## Post-Combat: Investigation

### Examining the Scene:

**Beau:** *(kneeling by horses)* "These are definitely Gundren's horses. They've been dead about a day. Poor things."

**Caleb:** *(examining arrows)* "Black feathers. Goblin make, crude but effective."

**Nott:** *(rifling through saddlebags)* "The bags are empty! Looted! And look—" *(holds up empty leather map case)* "This was Gundren's map case. It's empty."

**Fjord:** "So the goblins ambushed Gundren, killed his horses, took his map, and... where is he?"

### Survival Check - Finding the Trail:

**Caduceus:** *(kneeling, examining tracks)* "There's a trail here. Hidden behind those thickets on the north side."
- **Roll:** 1d20+3 (Survival) = 18 (rolled: 15+3)
- **DC:** 10
- **SUCCESS!**

**Caduceus:** "I count about a dozen goblins using this path. And these drag marks... two human-sized bodies were hauled away. Recently."

**Beau:** "Gundren and Sildar."

**Yasha:** *(quietly)* "...We follow."

---

## Goblin Trail Discovery

### What the Party Learns:
- **Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter were ambushed here ~24 hours ago**
- **Horses killed by goblin arrows**
- **Gundren's map case is empty (map stolen)**
- **Both Gundren and Sildar were dragged away alive (drag marks, no blood trail suggesting death)**
- **Goblin trail leads northwest into the woods (5 miles to Cragmaw Hideout)**

### Party Decision:
**Fjord:** "We can't just leave them. The cargo can wait."

**Jester:** "We have to save them! Gundren is our friend!"

**Caleb:** *(grimly)* "The wagon should be hidden. We follow on foot."

**Beau:** "Let's move. They've got a day's head start."

**Party votes unanimously to follow the goblin trail.**

## DM Notes

### Combat Analysis:
- **Surprise Round:** Goblins got first blood, but only Caduceus could act. His Bless was crucial for later rounds.
- **Party Firepower:** With 7 PCs, the goblins were obliterated in 2 rounds. Caleb's Burning Hands was overkill but cinematic.
- **Healing:** Caduceus and Jester used all their 1st-level slots for healing. This may bite them later.
- **Yasha's Rage:** Used early, still has 1 rage left. Will be crucial for harder fights.

### Tactical Highlights:
- **Nott's Sneak Attack:** Excellent use of advantage from ally positioning (Caleb near goblin)
- **Caleb's AOE:** Burning Hands hit 2 goblins, maximizing spell efficiency
- **Yasha's Mobility:** Jumping off wagon and charging with Rage was very effective
- **Caduceus's Support:** Bless + Healing Word combo kept party healthy

### Difficulty Assessment:
- **For 4-5 PCs (as designed):** This would be Moderate difficulty
- **For 7 PCs:** Easy difficulty - goblins had no chance
- **Recommendation:** Increase enemy numbers by 50% for future encounters (6 goblins instead of 4)

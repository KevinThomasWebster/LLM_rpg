# Location: The Abandoned Trapper's Cabin

**Atmosphere:** Ancient and lonely. This cabin predates Havenwood by a century. It is dilapidated, slowly being reclaimed by the forest. The air inside is thick with the smell of dust, decay, and old secrets. It feels like a place that has witnessed much and is tired of holding its silence.

**Description:** Deep in a part of the woods untouched by the Glimmer-rot, this small, single-room cabin is collapsing in on itself. The roof has partially caved in, and the walls are covered in moss. Inside, most of the furnishings have rotted away, but a sturdy, iron-bound chest remains in the corner, protected from the elements by a fallen roof beam.

**Secrets:**
*   The chest is locked with a puzzle lock that requires aligning three rings engraved with symbols: a Tree, a Star, and a Spiral. This is a symbol of the Veil-Walkers.
*   Inside the chest is the journal of one of the first Veil-Walkers in this region. It details a previous, smaller breach from the Penumbra centuries ago and the ritual of sealing that was used to close it. It speaks of the need for a "living key" to turn the "lock," providing the first clue about the sacrifice required for the sealing ritual.

Those who are sensitive to psychic energy or magic may feel a lingering presence in the cabin. This is the psychic echo of the original trapper, a man named Alistair. He was the first Veil-Walker to die sealing a rift in this valley. His echo is not a sentient ghost, but a repository of a single, repeating emotion: the profound sense of peace and purpose he felt in his final moments of sacrifice. A character who successfully meditates here may receive a vision of his sacrifice and gain advantage on their next saving throw against a fear effect.

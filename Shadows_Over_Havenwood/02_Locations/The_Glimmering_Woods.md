# The Glimmering Woods

**Atmosphere:** A fairytale forest turned into a nightmare. During the day, the Glimmer-rot appears as beautiful, iridescent, crystalline growths on trees and rocks. At night, it pulses with a soft, multicolored phosphorescence, creating a scene of breathtaking and deeply unsettling beauty. The air is thick with strange pollen, and the sounds of the forest are distorted and wrong.

**Description:** The Glimmering Woods is a section of the forest surrounding the base of Mount Haven. The further one travels into it, the more intense the Glimmer-rot becomes. Familiar paths twist and reform. The wildlife is mutated; deer with crystalline antlers, owls that cry with human-like voices, and swarms of insects that glow with malevolent intelligence.

**Features:**
*   **Glimmer-spores:** In areas of high concentration, the air is thick with spores that can cause disorientation, hallucinations, and, with prolonged exposure, the Glimmer-rot sickness itself.
*   **Whispering Trees:** Some ancient trees have been so thoroughly corrupted that they seem to whisper to passersby, offering power or revealing dark secrets to tempt them.
*   **Hunting Grounds:** This is the primary territory of the Glimmer-touched, who feel at home here. The Zealots patrol the woods, seeking to expand their territory and hunt down intruders.

Among the most dangerous creatures in the woods are the "Chime-Wolves." These are wolves that have been corrupted by the Glimmer-rot, their fur replaced with plates of resonant crystal and their howls transformed into a chorus of discordant chimes. They hunt in packs, and their chiming howls can disorient and paralyze their prey, making them easy targets. The alpha of the pack often has a large, pure crystal growing from its back, which can be harvested as a valuable arcane component.

# The Starfall Observatory

**Atmosphere:** A place of profound silence and wrongness. The observatory is a relic of a more optimistic and technologically advanced age, now fallen into decay. The architecture is a strange mix of brass, stone, and crystal, now marred by a decade of neglect and the creeping influence of the Penumbra. A faint, dissonant hum hangs in the air, and the light behaves strangely here.

**Description:** Located on the windswept peak of Mount Haven, the observatory is a multi-leveled structure. The main telescope dome is shattered, open to the sky like a broken eye. Inside, labs are filled with smashed equipment and notes that have dissolved into meaningless, swirling patterns. The Glimmer-rot is thickest here, forming pulsating, crystalline structures that emit a sickly, beautiful light.

**The Rift:** In the central chamber, where the main telescope array once focused, is the heart of the corruption: a shimmering, unstable tear in reality. It does not look like a door, but more like a heat haze or a distortion in the air, but looking at it for too long induces headaches and whispers at the edge of hearing. This is the weakened seal to the Penumbra.

**Dangers:** The observatory is infested with Glimmer-touched creatures and warped flora and fauna. The very environment is hostile, with pockets of distorted gravity, temporal loops, and psychic echoes of the disaster that created the rift.

The observatory was once powered by a massive, magically-grown crystal housed in the sub-basement, known as the "Heartstone." This crystal is now corrupted, acting as a battery and an amplifier for the Penumbra's influence. It is the source of the dissonant hum that fills the observatory. If the players can find a way to cleanse or destroy the Heartstone, they could significantly weaken the Glimmer-touched within the observatory and partially stabilize the rift, making their final confrontation easier.

# Locations Summary

This document provides an overview of the key locations in and around Havenwood.

## Key Locations

*   **Havenwood Town:** The adventure's hub. A cozy logging town with key points of interest like the Tipsy Dryad Tavern and the Town Hall. It hosts the annual Founder's Day festival, providing a potential backdrop for major events.

*   **The Glimmering Woods:** The supernaturally corrupted forest. Home to strange phenomena like Glimmer-spores, Whispering Trees, and dangerous mutated creatures like the "Chime-Wolves."

*   **The Starfall Observatory:** The adventure's main dungeon and the source of the Glimmer-rot. A derelict, multi-level facility powered by a corrupted "Heartstone" and home to the rift to the Penumbra.

*   **Elara's Cabin:** A warded sanctuary and home to the Veil-Walker leader. It is protected by a psychic alarm system known as the "Garden of Whispers."

*   **The Abandoned Trapper's Cabin:** A pre-Havenwood historical site containing the journal of a previous Veil-Walker and the psychic echo of his final sacrifice.

*   **The Old Lumber Mill:** An industrial horror location within the town. Its dark history makes it susceptible to the Penumbra's influence and a prime location for a tense encounter.

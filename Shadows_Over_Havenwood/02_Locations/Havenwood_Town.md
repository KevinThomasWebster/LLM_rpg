# Havenwood Town

**Atmosphere:** Cozy, isolated, and deceptively peaceful. The smell of pine, sawdust, and damp earth is ever-present. The town is nestled in a valley, surrounded by the imposing, dark green of the mountains. The buildings are sturdy, made of timber and stone, with smoke curling from chimneys. There's a strong sense of community, but also a feeling of being watched, and a tension beneath the surface.

## Points of Interest

*   **The Tipsy Dryad Tavern:** The social hub of Havenwood. Run by a boisterous retired adventurer named Breda. It's warm, lively, and the best place to gather rumors. Breda is a font of local lore but is fiercely protective of her patrons and the town's peaceful image.

*   **Town Hall & Guard Barracks:** A large, imposing stone building that houses the offices of the Town Council and the small town guard. The guard is led by Captain Eva Rost, a pragmatic and weary woman who has seen enough to be skeptical but is bound by the council's authority.

*   **The Rusty Axe General Store:** The only place to buy supplies for miles. It is run by the perpetually nervous Elias, who has been noticing strange things in the woods but is too afraid to speak up.

*   **The Lumber Mill:** The economic heart of the town, owned by Mayor Thorne's family. The constant buzz of the saws is a backdrop to life in Havenwood. The loggers who work there are a tough, superstitious lot and are often the first to encounter strange things in the forest.

Once a year, the town celebrates "Founder's Day," a holiday marking the day the first logging charter was signed. It's a day of feasting, logging competitions, and storytelling. This festival could serve as a backdrop for a major event in the adventure. Perhaps a Glimmer-touched attack disrupts the festivities, or the players use the celebration as a cover to investigate the Mayor's office. It provides a moment of levity and a clear picture of the community the players are trying to save.

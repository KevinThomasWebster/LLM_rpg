# Location: The Old Lumber Mill

**Atmosphere:** Industrial horror. The mill is a place of sharp metal, deep shadows, and the lingering smell of sawdust and oil. It is currently shut down for "repairs" by the Town Council, who are trying to hide the fact that several workers have gone missing or have been afflicted with the Glimmer-rot.

**Description:** A large, barn-like structure filled with dangerous equipment. Saws, conveyor belts, and wood chippers sit silent. The Glimmer-rot has begun to grow here, not on the trees, but on the metal of the machinery, giving it a strange, pulsating life. The area is littered with wood shavings and sawdust, perfect for muffling footstepsâ€”both the players' and their enemies'.

**Purpose:**
This location serves as a potential "dungeon" within the town itself. It's a place for a tense, horror-themed encounter where the Glimmer-touched can use the environment to their advantage, creating a deadly game of cat and mouse.

Locals whisper that the mill is cursed. Decades ago, before Mayor Thorne's family owned it, a terrible accident occurred. A foreman, known for his cruelty, was pushed into the main wood chipper by his overworked crew. They claimed it was an accident, but many believe it was murder. This dark history has stained the location, making it particularly susceptible to the Penumbra's influence and potentially providing a weakness for the creatures that now reside there.

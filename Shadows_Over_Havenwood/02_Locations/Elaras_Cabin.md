# Elara's Cabin

**Atmosphere:** A pocket of calm and ancient wisdom in a world descending into chaos. The cabin is warded against the influence of the Penumbra. The air here is clean, the sounds of the forest are natural, and there is a sense of peace and deep-rooted strength. 

**Description:** Hidden in a part of the forest untouched by the Glimmer-rot, Elara's cabin is a small, unassuming home made of silver birch and stone. It is surrounded by a sprawling garden of herbs, some mundane and others glowing with faint magical energy. The inside is cluttered but cozy, filled with drying herbs, arcane charts, and shelves of leather-bound books.

**Purpose:**
*   **Sanctuary:** The cabin is a safe place for the players to rest, recover, and research without fear of the Glimmer-rot or the Glimmer-touched. The wards prevent the Penumbra's influence from seeping in.
*   **Source of Knowledge:** Elara and her collection of lore are the primary source of information for the players about the true nature of the Penumbra, the Glimmer-rot, and the history of the Veil-Walkers.
*   **A Place of Testing:** Elara will not give her help freely. She will test the players' character, their intentions, and their abilities before she entrusts them with the secrets of the Veil-Walkers.

One of the most prominent defenses of the cabin is the "Garden of Whispers." The seemingly normal herbs and flowers are actually a sophisticated psychic alarm system. If a creature with hostile intent or a connection to the Penumbra approaches, the plants will begin to chime with a soft, bell-like sound, alerting Elara to the intrusion. The pollen from the flowers also causes confusion and disorientation in those who are not welcome, making a direct assault on the cabin nearly impossible for the Glimmer-touched.

# Adventure Summary: Shadows Over Havenwood

## Elevator Pitch

A character-driven mystery and horror adventure where players must uncover a dark secret connecting their forgotten past to a corrupting parallel dimension that threatens to consume their idyllic hometown.

## Core Concept

This adventure blends the cozy horror of a small town in peril with the cosmic dread of an alien dimension. The gameplay focuses on investigation, social interaction, and morally complex choices. The central mystery revolves around a forgotten childhood trauma that binds the player characters together. The world is designed to be reactive to player choice, with multiple factions to navigate and several distinct, choice-driven endings.

## Synopsis

The player characters, all residents of the quiet logging town of Havenwood, find their lives disrupted by shared nightmares and the appearance of a beautiful but terrifying corruption known as the "Glimmer-rot." Their investigation leads them to the sealed Starfall Observatory on Mount Haven, the epicenter of the infection. They must navigate the denial of the Town Council, the secrets of the mysterious Veil-Walkers, and the violence of the Glimmer-touched to uncover the truth: they were all present at the observatory a decade ago when an experiment went wrong, creating a rift to the alien dimension known as the Penumbra.

Now, the rift is weakening, and the entity on the other side is extending its influence. The players must return to the observatory and confront the source of the corruption. Their journey will force them to reckon with their past and decide the fate of Havenwood. The adventure is designed to culminate in a choice that reflects their actions and moral journey: Will they make a noble sacrifice to seal the rift forever? Will they choose a more destructive but immediate solution? Or will they be tempted by the Penumbra's power and choose to join it?

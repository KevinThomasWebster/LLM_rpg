### Scene: The Hunter's Game

**DM:** You enter the Old Lumber Mill with confidence. You've faced Glimmer-touched before. You know the signs, you know the enemy. The vast, silent room of machinery doesn't intimidate you. Ronan strides into the center of the room, axe over his shoulder, while Alistair begins a methodical search of the perimeter. Elara, however, feels a prickle of unease.

**Elara:** "Be careful. It's quiet... too quiet. The rot feels different here. It's not just angry, it's... clever."

**Ronan:** "Let it be clever. It'll still bleed." He kicks at the large pile of sawdust in the center of the room. "Come on out! We don't have all night!"

**Alistair:** "Ronan, knock it off. You're going to get one of us killed." He's examining a series of chains hanging from the ceiling, noting the strange, pulsing Glimmer-rot that has grown over them.

**DM:** Ronan's taunt is met with silence. Nothing happens. He scoffs and turns to join Alistair. As soon as his back is turned to the sawdust pile, a shape explodes from within it. It's the Mill-Thing. But it doesn't attack Ronan. Instead, it moves with blinding speed towards Alistair, who is engrossed in the chains.

**DM:** Before Alistair can react, the creature is on him. It doesn't use its claws. Instead, it slams its body into him, sending him stumbling into the hanging chains. The Glimmer-rot on the chains flares, and a jolt of corrupted energy courses through Alistair. He cries out in pain and his muscles lock up. His pistol clatters to the floor. He is paralyzed.

**Ronan:** "Al!" He spins around and charges, but the creature is already gone. It has darted away, disappearing into the shadows beneath a large planing machine.

**Elara:** She rushes to Alistair's side. He's conscious, but his body is rigid, his eyes wide with pain and anger. "It's the rot! It used it like a weapon! He's paralyzed!" She begins to chant, trying to draw the corrupting energy out of him.

**DM:** From the darkness, the creature's mocking laugh echoes. Then, a new sound: the creak of a lever, followed by a loud hiss. A cloud of thick, obscuring steam begins to pour from pipes near the ceiling, rapidly filling the area and reducing visibility to only a few feet. You are being separated.

**Ronan:** "I'll kill it!" He roars in frustration, gripping his axe and peering into the swirling steam. "Show yourself!"

**DM:** A dark shape lunges out of the mist. Ronan swings his axe, but it connects with a heavy log, which had been swung down from the ceiling on a chain. It was a feint. The real attack comes from his other side. The Mill-Thing darts out of the steam, rakes its metal claws across Ronan's legs, and disappears back into the fog before he can retaliate. The attack is shallow, but it hobbles him.

**Ronan:** He cries out in pain and drops to one knee, his leg bleeding freely. "It's toying with us!"

**DM:** Elara, you are still with Alistair. You can hear Ronan's cry of pain somewhere in the mist. You know you need to do something, but if you leave Alistair, he is helpless. The creature is hunting you, picking you apart one by one.

**Elara:** Her hands glow with a soft, green light as she continues her healing chant. She has to make a choice. "Ronan! Talk to me! Where are you?" She looks around, her eyes wide with fear, trying to see through the thick, rolling steam.

**DM:** A voice whispers directly into her ear, a dry, rasping sound like grinding stones. "He can't help you." The Mill-Thing is right behind her.

**Elara:** She screams and spins around, unleashing a blast of pure, cleansing energy. The light strikes the creature, which hisses and recoils, its skin smoking where the light touched it. It stumbles back into the mist, momentarily repelled.

**DM:** The steam begins to dissipate. Ronan is on one knee, wounded but defiant. Alistair is beginning to move his fingers, the paralysis slowly fading thanks to Elara's magic. The creature is nowhere to be seen, but you know it's still here. Watching. Waiting. Your confidence is shattered, replaced by a primal fear. You are not the hunters here. You are the prey.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This session was designed to punish overconfidence, and it succeeded spectacularly. The creature used its stealth, its knowledge of the environment, and hit-and-run tactics to systematically disable and demoralize the party. It felt intelligent and truly dangerous.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Ronan:** His initial arrogance was the catalyst for the disaster. His inability to land a solid blow and his subsequent injury effectively humbled him.
*   **Alistair:** Being taken out of the fight so early and so effectively was a powerful demonstration of the creature's tactical acumen. It showed that no one was safe.
*   **Elara:** She was forced into the role of protector and sole defender, creating a desperate and tense situation. Her final blast of power was a great climactic moment for her character.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was brutal and effective. The encounter spiraled out of the players' control very quickly. The use of paralysis, environmental obscurity (steam), and feints made the Mill-Thing feel like a highly intelligent predator. The session ended on a cliffhanger, with the party wounded and afraid, which is a perfect tone for a horror encounter.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** This was a very difficult version of the encounter. While it worked well to create a sense of horror, it could potentially lead to a Total Party Kill (TPK) if the players don't have access to some form of healing or magic. It might be worth considering what happens if Elara isn't there. Perhaps the paralysis from the chains is temporary (e.g., lasts for 1d4 rounds) even without intervention, giving a non-magical party a chance to recover.

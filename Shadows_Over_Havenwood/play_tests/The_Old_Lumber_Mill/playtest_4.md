### Scene: The Devil's Workshop

**DM:** You stand in the center of the Old Lumber Mill, a vast chamber of dormant machinery. The silence is a heavy blanket, disturbed only by your own breathing. You've found no sign of the missing workers, only the sickly, pulsating Glimmer-rot that coats the metal equipment. Suddenly, the silence is broken. A low, guttural laugh echoes from the rafters above, seeming to come from all directions at once. Then, with a deafening groan of protesting metal, the machinery of the mill roars to life around you.

**Alistair:** "Scatter! Get to cover!" He dives behind a massive, iron log-splitter as conveyor belts begin to move, saw blades spin, and pistons hiss with renewed life.

**Elara:** She stumbles back, overwhelmed by the sudden surge of corrupted energy. "It's not just one machine, it's all of them! The rot is acting like a nervous system!" She takes refuge in the narrow space between two large hydraulic presses.

**Ronan:** He stands his ground in the middle of the floor, axe ready, turning in a slow circle. "Show yourself, you coward! Face me!"

**DM:** Ronan, your challenge is answered, but not in the way you expect. The conveyor belt you are standing near, previously still, lurches into motion. It begins to pull you off your feet, dragging you slowly but inexorably towards a large, spinning chipper blade designed to strip bark from logs. The floor is slick with oil, making it hard to get a footing.

**Ronan:** "Agh! It's got me!" He digs his heels in, but the belt is too strong. He tries to chop the belt with his axe, but the moving, rubberized surface just absorbs the blow.

**Alistair:** "Ronan!" Alistair leaves his cover, looking for the control panel for the conveyor. He spots it, but it's on the other side of the moving belt, about 20 feet away. To get there, he'd have to cross the dangerous, lurching surface.

**DM:** As Alistair weighs his options, the Mill-Thing drops from the ceiling, landing silently behind Elara. She is unaware, her attention focused on Ronan's plight. The creature raises its sharpened metal claws, preparing to strike the vulnerable herbalist in the back.

**Elara:** At the last second, she feels a shift in the air, a spike of malevolent energy. She cries out and throws herself to the side without looking, tumbling into the open. The creature's claws rake across the hydraulic press where she was just standing, leaving deep gouges in the steel.

**DM:** The creature shrieks in frustration and turns its attention to her. Alistair, you now have a choice: help Ronan, who is being dragged towards the bark-stripper, or help Elara, who is now exposed and being stalked by the Mill-Thing.

**Alistair:** "Damn it all!" He makes a split-second decision. He turns his pistol on the creature menacing Elara and fires twice. "Elara, run! Get to the main panel! Shut it all down!" He hopes the shots will be enough to make the creature pause.

**DM:** The bullets hit the creature's torso, causing it to stagger back. It gives Elara a hateful glare, then scurries away, disappearing behind a large furnace. Elara doesn't waste the opportunity and sprints towards the main control room overlooking the floor. Meanwhile, Ronan is still being dragged. He has about 10 seconds before he reaches the spinning blades.

**Ronan:** "Don't worry about me!" he yells, his voice strained. He gives up on fighting the belt and instead turns his attention to the machine itself. He jams the handle of his axe into the gears of the conveyor's motor. 

**DM:** There is a horrible grinding sound, a shower of sparks, and a high-pitched mechanical scream. The conveyor belt shudders, lurches, and then with a final groan, it stops. The motor is destroyed. Ronan is safe, only a few feet from the now-stationary blades. At the same moment, Elara reaches the control room and, with a desperate shove, slams the emergency shutdown lever. With a final, dying whine, all the machinery in the mill spins down into silence.

**Alistair:** He rushes over to Ronan, helping him off the belt. "You crazy bastard. That was reckless."

**Ronan:** He retrieves his damaged axe, the handle splintered. "But it worked." He looks up towards the rafters. "Now it knows we can fight back against its tricks."

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This session was a direct test of the "Lair Action" concept, and it created a dynamic and chaotic combat puzzle. The simultaneous threats forced the players into making difficult tactical choices.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Alistair:** Faced a classic "Sophie's Choice" and made a logical decision to protect the more vulnerable party member while trusting the more resilient one to save himself. This was excellent roleplaying under pressure.
*   **Ronan:** His solution to his predicament was creative and perfectly in character. Instead of waiting for help, he took direct, decisive (and destructive) action. A great heroic moment.
*   **Elara:** Her last-second dodge was a great use of her character's passive abilities, and her sprint to the shutdown lever was a crucial, high-stakes objective.

**Encounter Flow:** The encounter was tense and exciting. The environmental hazard felt like a genuine threat that could have seriously harmed or killed a character. The creature's role as a saboteur who creates these situations, rather than just a direct brawler, was strongly reinforced.

**Grade:** A

**Suggested Revisions:** The difficulty of Ronan's situation was high. It might be beneficial to include more than one way to stop the conveyor belt. For instance, a smaller, more accessible emergency stop button near the machine itself, which might only stop that specific hazard but is easier to get to. This provides more options for different party compositions and skill sets.

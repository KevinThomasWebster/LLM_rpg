### Scene: The Silent Mill

**DM:** The Old Lumber Mill looms before you, a skeletal silhouette against the bruised twilight sky. The air is thick with the ghosts of sounds—the shriek of saws, the rumble of machinery—but all is now unnervingly silent. A sign hangs crookedly from the main gate, its hand-painted letters stark: "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS - KEEP OUT." The scent of pine and sawdust is heavy, but underneath it, a strange, metallic tang, like ozone and decay, prickles at your nostrils. The massive main doors are slightly ajar, a dark maw inviting you into the shadows.

**Alistair:** (Muttering to the others) "Repairs. Right. And I'm the Queen of May. Thorne's council is hiding something, and I'll bet my last dollar it's in there. Let's be smart about this. No sense announcing our arrival." Alistair scans the perimeter, his eyes narrowed, looking for any other points of entry or signs of recent activity.

**Elara:** She shivers, pulling her shawl tighter around her shoulders. "The air feels... wrong. Sick. The Glimmer-rot is here, I can feel it. It's not like in the woods. It's... angry. Twisted." She reaches out a hand, not touching, but sensing the energy emanating from the building.

**Ronan:** His jaw is tight, his gaze fixed on the half-open doors. "I knew three men who worked this mill. Good men. They wouldn't just leave. Whatever's in there, it has answers." He puts a hand on the door, ready to push it open.

**DM:** Alistair, your keen eyes spot tracks near the side of the building, leading to a smaller, rusted service door. They're faint, partially obscured by sawdust, but they look recent. Ronan, as your hand touches the main door, you feel a faint, low hum vibrating through the wood, a dissonant thrum that seems to resonate in your bones. Elara, the feeling is strongest here, a pulsating web of corrupted energy clinging to the metal machinery within.

**Alistair:** "Hold on, Ron. Over here. Someone's been using this side door. Let's not walk in the front door if we don't have to." He gestures for the others to follow, moving cautiously towards the service entrance.

**DM:** The service door groans in protest as Alistair coaxes it open, revealing a cramped, dark corridor. The smell of oil and rot is stronger here. It opens into the main mill floor, a cavernous space filled with the hulking, silent shapes of industrial saws, planers, and conveyor belts. Moonlight streams through grimy upper windows, casting long, distorted shadows. And everywhere, on the teeth of saw blades, along the chains of conveyor belts, a strange, faint luminescence pulses—the Glimmer-rot, growing on the cold, hard steel. In the center of the room, a huge pile of sawdust sits like a pale, sleeping beast.

**Elara:** "By the Ancients... It's growing on the metal. I've never seen this before. It's... adapting." She takes a hesitant step into the room, her eyes wide with a mixture of horror and fascination.

**Ronan:** He follows, his hand resting on the handle of his woodsman's axe. His eyes scan the machinery, the sawdust pile, the deep pools of shadow. "This place is a tinderbox. And a tomb."

**DM:** As you step further into the mill, a floorboard creaks loudly under Ronan's boot. The sound echoes in the vast space. For a moment, there is only silence. Then, from the far side of the room, a loud *CLANG* rings out as a heavy wrench falls from a catwalk, as if carelessly knocked over.

**Alistair:** He ducks instinctively, pulling the collar of his coat up. "Get down! We're not alone." He draws his pistol, its metallic click unnaturally loud in the silence, and takes cover behind a large stack of lumber, peering towards the catwalk.

**DM:** You see nothing on the catwalk. The wrench lies on the concrete floor, gleaming in the moonlight. But as your attention is drawn upwards, a shape erupts from the sawdust pile in the center of the room. It's a man, or what's left of one. His skin is pale and stretched, his limbs elongated and twisted. Shards of rusted metal and splintered wood are fused to his hands, forming crude, vicious claws. A low, guttural hiss escapes his throat as a cloud of fine, shimmering dust puffs into the air around him. This is the Mill-Thing. It fixes its hollow eyes on Ronan and lunges forward with terrifying speed.

**Ronan:** "Get back!" he yells, raising his axe to meet the creature's charge. He's strong, but the thing's unnatural speed catches him off guard.

**DM:** The Mill-Thing's metal claws screech against Ronan's axe. The impact is jarring, sending a shock up Ronan's arms. The creature is unnaturally strong. Elara, you see an old control panel near the wall, covered in levers and buttons, a thick layer of dust on its surface. Alistair, from your position, you have a clear shot, but the creature is grappling with Ronan, making it a risky one.

**Elara:** "The machinery! It's connected to it!" She remembers the hum, the energy. "Alistair, the control panel! Maybe we can use it!" She begins to move towards the panel, her heart pounding.

**Alistair:** "Don't just stand there, Elara, do something! Ron, try to pin it!" He holds his aim steady, waiting for a clean shot, the tension coiling in his shoulders.

**DM:** Ronan roars, putting all his strength into a shove, pushing the Mill-Thing back a step. It stumbles, giving Alistair the opening he needs. He fires. The shot cracks through the mill, and the bullet strikes the creature in the shoulder, sending it reeling back with a shriek of pain and rage. It glares at Alistair, then its eyes dart towards Elara as she reaches the control panel. With another hiss, it turns and disappears, diving back into the massive sawdust pile with a soft *whump*. The mill is silent once more, the only sound the ringing in your ears and the frantic beating of your own hearts.

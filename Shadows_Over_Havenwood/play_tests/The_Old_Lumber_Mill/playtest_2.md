### Scene: The Whirring Blades

**DM:** The main doors of the Old Lumber Mill are slightly ajar, spilling a sliver of deep darkness from within. The air is cold and carries the scent of sawdust and something acrid, like burnt wiring. Ronan, you feel a low, almost subliminal hum vibrating through the heavy wooden door. Ignoring Alistair's call for a more cautious approach, you push the door open. It groans, the sound echoing into a vast, cavernous space. Before you is the main mill floor, a metal jungle of silent, menacing machinery. Moonlight filters through high, grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A thick blanket of sawdust covers much of the floor, muffling your footsteps as you step inside.

**Ronan:** "I'm tired of sneaking around. My friends might be in here." He steps in boldly, his hand resting on his axe, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement.

**Alistair:** (Sighing in exasperation) "Bold, Ronan. Let's hope you're not also dead." He follows, pistol drawn, sticking close to the wall and using the large machines for cover.

**Elara:** She follows Ronan, her senses overwhelmed. "The rot... it's singing. It's in the machines. Be careful, the very metal is wrong here." She points to a conveyor belt where the Glimmer-rot pulses with a sickly green-purple light.

**DM:** As you move towards the center of the room, a sudden, deafening *SCREEECH* erupts from your right. A massive band saw, its teeth coated in glowing rot, roars to life. The conveyor belt beneath it lurches forward, dragging a half-cut log towards the screaming blade. The noise is immense, disorienting. And from the opposite side of the room, you hear a soft *thump*, as if something heavy has just dropped down from the rafters.

**Alistair:** "It's a distraction! Watch the shadows!" He whirls around, trying to pinpoint the source of the second sound, his gun tracking through the darkness.

**DM:** You see it for just a second—a pale, lanky figure darting between a wood chipper and a stack of lumber. It's too fast to get a clear look. Ronan, you are closest to the now-active saw. The noise is rattling your teeth, and the psychoactive spores from the Glimmer-rot on the blade are making you feel dizzy and nauseous.

**Ronan:** He shakes his head, trying to clear it. "It's trying to split us up! Elara, can you shut that thing down?" He stands his ground, planting his feet and raising his axe, turning his back to the saw to face the direction the creature disappeared.

**Elara:** "I'll try!" She looks around frantically and spots a control panel near the saw, sparks flying from a rusted conduit connected to it. It looks dangerous. "The wiring is corrupted! Touching it might be... unwise."

**DM:** Alistair, you catch another flicker of movement near the giant sawdust pile in the center of the room. A shape is burrowing into it with unnatural speed. At the same time, Elara, you notice a large, red lever on the main control panel across the room, labeled "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN." It seems to control the power to the entire mill floor.

**Alistair:** "It's in the sawdust! It's hiding in the damn sawdust! Don't get near it!" He fires a shot into the pile, which is swallowed with a soft *puff*, having no discernible effect.

**Elara:** "The emergency stop! Across the room! I'm going for it!" She breaks from cover and makes a mad dash across the open floor towards the main panel.

**DM:** As Elara runs, the Mill-Thing erupts from the sawdust directly in her path. It doesn't attack, but lands with a heavy thud, blocking her way to the lever. It stands to its full, grotesque height, metal claws dripping with some foul substance, and lets out a piercing shriek—a sound of metal grinding and a man screaming in agony. The sound is designed to terrify, to freeze you in your tracks.

**Ronan:** "Elara!" Without a second thought, he charges the creature, axe held high. "Get out of the way!"

**DM:** Ronan, you close the distance with a warrior's yell. You bring your axe down in a powerful arc. The creature, surprisingly, doesn't dodge. It raises its own crude claw to parry. The impact is immense, and the sharpened metal on its arm breaks your axe handle, sending the axe head flying across the room where it lands with a *clang*. The Mill-Thing uses the opening to slam its other claw into your side, not cutting deep, but the impact feels like being hit by a sledgehammer, knocking the wind out of you and sending you staggering back.

**Alistair:** "Ron!" Seeing his friend disarmed and wounded, Alistair abandons his cover. He runs forward, firing his pistol rapidly. "Get away from him, you freak!" The shots force the creature to back away from Ronan, giving him space. It turns its hateful, hollow eyes towards Alistair, hisses, and then with another burst of speed, it scrambles up a pile of logs and disappears into the labyrinthine machinery of the ceiling.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This session tested a more direct confrontation. Activating the machinery as a distraction worked well to create chaos and split the party's focus. The creature felt more like a saboteur and a threat, using the environment proactively.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Ronan:** His bull-headed charge was in character and drove the action forward, but it also showed the danger of facing the creature head-on. The breaking of his axe was a great moment of unexpected drama.
*   **Alistair:** Reacted well to the changing situation, shifting from cautious investigator to protective gunslinger. His covering fire was crucial.
*   **Elara:** Her focus on the environmental solution (the emergency stop) was a smart tactical choice, and her run across the open floor created a lot of tension.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was fast-paced and chaotic, fitting for a horror encounter. The creature's tactics were varied—distraction, intimidation, and a swift, powerful strike before retreating. This reinforces its role as a hunter, not a brawler.

**Grade:** A-

**Suggested Revisions:** The consequence of Ronan's charge (broken axe) was improvised but worked very well. It might be worth codifying a "gear break" mechanic for critical failures or when parrying the Mill-Thing's unnaturally tough claws. This would add another layer of desperation and resource management to the encounter.

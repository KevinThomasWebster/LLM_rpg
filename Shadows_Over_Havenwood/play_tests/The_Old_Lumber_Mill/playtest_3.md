### Scene: Echoes of the Past

**DM:** You find the Old Lumber Mill utterly silent, a tomb of industry. You slip in through a side door, finding yourselves in the shadow of a massive, silent wood chipper. The air is cold and still. Piles of sawdust lay like snowdrifts on the floor, and the metallic tang of Glimmer-rot is a constant, sharp presence. You've been inside for ten minutes, moving slowly, methodically, but have found nothing. No creature, no clues, just silence.

**Alistair:** "This is wrong. It feels like we're being watched. Toyed with." He kneels, examining a set of deep gouges in the concrete floor near the wood chipper. "These look like something was dragged. Something heavy." He looks up at the machinery, his eyes narrowed in thought.

**Ronan:** "I've worked in mills my whole life. They're never this quiet. Even shut down, there's a hum. A memory of noise. This... this is a dead quiet." He runs a hand over a nearby control panel, wiping away a thick layer of dust. On a small, faded brass plaque, he reads the name: "Thorne & Sons Lumber Co. Est. 1954."

**Elara:** She has her eyes closed, concentrating. "The rot is thin here, like a spider's web stretched taut. It's waiting. Listening. There's a... a knot of old pain in this place, too. Something violent. Something that isn't the Glimmer." She opens her eyes and looks towards the main control room, a dusty, glass-paned office overlooking the mill floor.

**DM:** As Elara mentions the old pain, you all hear it: a faint, high-pitched whining sound, like a steam whistle being bled very slowly. It lasts for only a second, then cuts off. It seems to come from the direction of the main control room. At the same time, from the rafters above, a fine shower of sawdust drifts down, catching the moonlight like malevolent sprites.

**Alistair:** "The control room. Let's go. Together." He motions for the others to follow, keeping his back to a large metal pillar as he moves, his pistol sweeping the shadowy upper reaches of the mill.

**DM:** You make your way to the control room. The door is unlocked. Inside, it's a mess of old papers, dusty logbooks, and a large control console covered in levers and gauges. One particular lever, painted a faded yellow, has a small, steady trickle of steam leaking from its base. This is the source of the sound. A tag attached to it reads: "WORKDAY WHISTLE."

**Elara:** "This is it. The pain. It's connected to this sound." She looks through the dusty glass, down at the mill floor. From this vantage point, you can see the entire layout. You can also see what you couldn't before: a subtle, shifting trail in the largest of the sawdust piles, as if something large is moving just beneath the surface.

**Ronan:** He picks up a leather-bound logbook from the desk. The last few pages are filled with frantic, scrawled entries. The final one is chilling: "It hates the whistle. The foreman hated it too. Said it was the sound of freedom for the rest of us. Now it's the only thing that makes the ghost recoil..."

**DM:** As Ronan reads the words aloud, a furious shriek echoes from the mill floor below. The Mill-Thing bursts from the sawdust, no longer hiding. It looks up at the control room, its hollow eyes burning with a cold fire. It seems to understand what you've found. It begins to scramble up the side of a cutting machine, moving with unnatural speed, its metal claws finding purchase on the steel frame. It's coming for you.

**Alistair:** "The whistle! Hit the whistle!" He takes aim through the glass, preparing to fire at the creature as it climbs.

**Ronan:** He doesn't hesitate. He grabs the yellow lever with both hands and pulls with all his might.

**DM:** The lever resists for a moment, then gives way with a groan of rusted metal. A deafening, high-pitched shriek fills the entire mill as the steam whistle blows at full pressure. It's a piercing, painful sound. Below you, the Mill-Thing convulses. It clutches its head, its own shriek drowned out by the whistle. It loses its grip on the machine and tumbles to the concrete floor, where it lies twitching and disoriented. It is completely stunned.

**Elara:** "Now! While it's weak!" She points, her voice trembling but resolute.

**Alistair:** "Don't have to tell me twice." He shatters the glass of the control room window with the butt of his pistol and takes careful aim at the stunned creature on the floor below.

**Ronan:** He looks from the stunned creature to the logbook, then back. "The foreman... this thing is what's left of that monster." He grips his axe, his knuckles white. "Let's give him the peace he never gave his men."

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This session focused on the investigation and discovery aspect of the encounter, and it was highly successful. The slow-burn tension, the environmental clues, and the final reveal of the creature's weakness all landed perfectly. The lore of the murdered foreman was integrated naturally through the logbook.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **The Party:** Worked together exceptionally well as an investigative unit. They were patient, observant, and pieced together the clues logically.
*   **Elara:** Her psychic sensitivity was the catalyst for the discovery, guiding the party to the right location and identifying the emotional resonance.
*   **Ronan:** His discovery of the logbook was the critical moment of revelation. It was a great piece of player-driven storytelling.
*   **Alistair:** His constant vigilance and tactical awareness kept the party safe during the investigation phase.

**Encounter Flow:** The pacing was excellent. It moved from quiet tension to a sudden burst of frantic action. The discovery of the weakness felt earned, and its effect was dramatic and decisive, giving the players a clear and powerful advantage that they had worked for.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** None. This is the ideal way for the encounter to play out. The clues are there, they are discoverable, and they lead to a satisfying and strategic conclusion. This is a model execution of the encounter's design.

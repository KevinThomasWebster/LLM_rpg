### Scene: Buried Alive

**DM:** You are the demolition crew at the end of the world. Three pillars, three charges. The plan is simple. The execution, however, is immediately complicated by the appearance of the **Unraveling Guardian**, a being of pure chaos that flows down from the ceiling to obstruct you.

**Alistair:** "Stick to the plan! Place the charges!" He heads for the central pillar.

**Ronan:** He charges towards his pillar on the right, but decides to engage the Guardian directly. "I'll keep it busy! You two plant the bombs!"

**DM:** Ronan slams his axe into the Guardian. The creature has no solid form, and the weapon passes through it, meeting little resistance. The Guardian, in turn, envelops Ronan in its gibbering mass. He isn't taking much damage, but he is effectively stuck, his senses overwhelmed by the cacophony.

**Elara:** "Ronan, no! You can't fight it!" Seeing him trapped, she abandons her objective and rushes to help him, trying to use her magic to push the creature back.

**DM:** Elara's magic has some effect, causing the Guardian to recoil, but now both she and Ronan are locked in a pointless struggle with an enemy they can't truly hurt, while Alistair is on his own. 

**Alistair:** "What are you doing?! The charges!" He reaches his pillar and arms the first charge. **(1 of 3 charges placed.)** He turns and sees his friends wasting precious time. "Forget it! Get to the pillars!"

**DM:** Realizing their mistake, Ronan and Elara break off from the Guardian and head for their objectives. But they have lost a crucial amount of time. Elara reaches her pillar and begins the arming sequence. **(2 of 3 charges placed.)** Just as she finishes, a chunk of the ceiling falls, striking her. She cries out in pain, her leg clearly broken.

**Elara:** "Agh! My leg! I can't move!"

**DM:** Ronan, seeing Elara fall, is the last to place his charge. He finally slams it into place and arms it. **(3 of 3 charges placed.)** The klaxon blares. "EVACUATE. 3..."

**Alistair:** "Elara!" He runs to her side, trying to help her up. She can't put any weight on her leg.

**Ronan:** "I'll carry her!" He sheathes his axe and lifts Elara onto his broad shoulders. Her weight slows him down significantly.

**DM:** "2..." The party, now moving at half speed, hobbles towards the exit. The Guardian, its job done, flows in front of them, not to stop them, but to form a wall of disorienting light, forcing them to navigate around it and costing them another precious second.

**Alistair:** "It's herding us! Taking too long!" He tries to find a way around, but the path is choked with rubble.

**DM:** "1..." You are only halfway to the exit. A massive fissure opens up directly in your path, cutting off your escape. It is at least 20 feet across. You are trapped.

**Ronan:** He looks at the fissure, then at the crumbling ceiling. He sets Elara down gently. "I'm sorry. I was a fool." 

**Alistair:** He looks at the ceiling, then at his friends. He simply nods, his face grim, and reloads his pistol, as if by instinct.

**DM:** "0..." The klaxon dies. For a single, beautiful moment, there is silence. Then, with a sound like the world breaking, the mountain consumes you. The observatory, the rift, and the heroes of Havenwood are all buried together under a million tons of rock. You have succeeded in your mission. But you are not alive to see it.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This playtest demonstrated how a single bad tactical decision at the start could doom the entire encounter. The failure felt earned and was a direct consequence of the players' actions.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Ronan:** His decision to fight the Guardian instead of focusing on the objective was the critical error. It was in character for him to be brave, but it was the wrong tactical choice, and it cost the party everything.
*   **Elara:** Her choice to help Ronan compounded the initial mistake, taking another player off the objective.
*   **Alistair:** He played his part perfectly, but was let down by his teammates. His attempts to get them back on track came too late.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was a slow-motion disaster. The initial mistake led to a cascade of problems: lost time, an injury, and ultimately, being trapped. The final moments were grim and resonant. The encounter successfully showed that victory (destroying the rift) and survival are not the same thing.

**Grade:** A

**Suggested Revisions:** None. The encounter is designed to be a frantic race against time, and it punishes poor choices severely, which is appropriate for a climax. The fact that the players can succeed in their mission but still lose their lives is a powerful and memorable outcome.

### Scene: The Unbearable Lightness of Being

**DM:** You have come to the rift not to destroy or seal it, but to seek entry. As you approach, the chaotic energies coalesce into a serene, humanoid figure made of pure, white light. A **Deva** of the Penumbra. The landscape around you shifts, the broken observatory replaced by a surreal, twisted version of Havenwood. The Guardian raises a sword of solidified light.

**Guardian:** (Its voice is a calm, melodic chorus) "You seek Union. You believe yourselves worthy. We shall see. The flawed cannot join the perfect. Shed your weakness, or be shed from existence."

**Ronan:** He grips his axe. "I am not weak." He charges.

**DM:** Ronan swings his axe. The Guardian easily parries it, the impact creating a shower of musical sparks. The Guardian counters with a swift strike of its own. The blow lands, and Ronan feels not just pain, but a voice in his mind.

**Guardian:** (Telepathically to Ronan) *"Can you bear the weight of a perfect world? Your attachments make you fragile."

**Alistair:** "It's a test. It's not trying to kill us, it's trying to... break us." He opens fire, his bullets splashing harmlessly against the Guardian's form.

**Elara:** "The energy... it's not of the Glimmer-rot. It's something else. Pure, but... sterile. Uncaring." She unleashes a blast of her own cleansing energy, and for the first time, the Guardian seems to notice, turning its blank face towards her.

**DM:** The Guardian glides towards Elara, ignoring the others. It moves with impossible grace, its light-sword a blur. It strikes her again and again. Elara tries to defend herself, but she is no warrior. Her energy is spent, and she falls.

**DM:** Elara, you are at 0 hit points. You are not unconscious, but paralyzed, floating in a void of white light. The Guardian's voice fills your mind. "You cling to a dying world. Let it go. Join the chorus." You must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

**Elara:** (She sees visions of her home, of the forest, of her friends. She sees them all turning to dust.) "No... a world without struggle is a world without love. I will not let you have them!" **(DM Note: Elara succeeds on her saving throw.)**

**DM:** A wave of golden light bursts from Elara. She is back on her feet, a single point of warmth and life in her eyes. The Guardian turns away from her. "You are worthy," it says, and it will no longer target her.

**Ronan:** He watches in amazement, then a grim understanding dawns on his face. "I see. This is not a fight we win with strength." He turns to Alistair. "We have to face it. We have to let it strike us down."

**Alistair:** "Are you insane? It disintegrated a man with a touch!"

**Ronan:** "No. It tested him. And he failed." He drops his axe. "I am ready."

**DM:** The Guardian turns its attention to Ronan. It glides forward and runs him through with its sword of light. Ronan collapses, paralyzed at 0 hit points. "You fight for memories," the Guardian whispers in his mind. "Memories are echoes of imperfection. Let them fade." You must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

**Ronan:** (He sees the faces of his lost friends, and for a moment, he is tempted to let go, to join them in oblivion. But then he sees Elara, alive, and Alistair, afraid. His new friends.) "My memories don't make me weak. They make me strong!" **(DM Note: Ronan succeeds.)**

**DM:** Ronan gets to his feet, the light of the Guardian's grace knitting his wounds. "You are worthy."

**DM:** Only Alistair is left. He stands alone, pistol shaking in his hand. He has seen his friends fall and rise again. He understands now. He holsters his pistol and gives a short, sharp nod.

**Alistair:** "Alright, you bastard. Let's get this over with."

**DM:** The Guardian approaches. It places a hand on Alistair's forehead. "You see only the flaws, the cracks in the world. You seek a truth that is absolute. We can give it to you." Alistair is brought to 0 hit points. You must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

**Alistair:** (He sees a world of perfect order, of clean lines and absolute logic. It is beautiful. It is also sterile and dead. He thinks of the messiness of life, the chaos of friendship, the bitter taste of cheap whiskey.) "A perfect world is a cage. I'd rather be free." **(DM Note: Alistair succeeds.)**

**DM:** Alistair is restored. All three of you now stand before the Guardian, which lowers its sword and bows its head. "You are all worthy. You have faced oblivion and not flinched. You have chosen the pain of your world over the peace of ours. The Union will be stronger for it." The Guardian dissolves, and the path into the rift is now open, a shimmering doorway to a new and terrible destiny.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This was a fascinating and unusual encounter. The unique win condition (being defeated) and the Charisma saving throw mechanic worked extremely well, creating a battle of wills rather than a battle of attrition.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   The players' journey from confusion to understanding was the core of the session. Ronan's realization of the test's true nature was the turning point.
*   Each character's internal struggle during their saving throw was a great roleplaying moment, reinforcing their core personalities.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was strange and dreamlike, fitting the surreal nature of the encounter. It was less about tactical positioning and more about a sequence of revelatory moments. The tension came not from the fear of dying, but from the fear of being found unworthy and erased from existence.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** This encounter is heavily dependent on roleplaying and player buy-in. For a group that is more focused on tactical combat, it might fall flat. It would be useful to have a hint or clue somewhere before the observatory that suggests the nature of the Guardian's test, so that players are not completely blindsided by the bizarre mechanics.

### Scene: The Unmaking

**DM:** You stand in the central chamber of the Starfall Observatory, not as saviors, but as demolitionists. In your hands are three bulky, magically-charged satchels that hum with contained power. Your goal is simple and brutal: place them on the three main structural supports and bring the entire mountain down on top of the rift. The supports are massive pillars of stone and brass, humming with the Glimmer-rot's energy.

**Alistair:** "Alright, here's the plan. Ronan, you take the pillar on the right. Elara, the one on the left. I'll take the central one. We place the charges, we arm them, and we get the hell out. Fast and clean." He gives them a grim look. "Don't be a hero. Just get it done."

**Ronan:** "Fast and clean. Got it." He hefts his charge and his axe, his eyes fixed on his target.

**Elara:** She nods, her face pale. "May the spirits of the mountain forgive us for this." She clutches her satchel and begins moving towards her objective.

**DM:** As you separate, the rift seems to notice your intent. The air grows cold, and a being of pure, chaotic energy coalesces near the ceiling. It is a formless mass of crystalline light and gibbering mouthsâ€”the **Unraveling Guardian**. It descends, not to attack, but to block your path, its mere presence a disorienting assault on the senses.

**Alistair:** "It's trying to slow us down! Ignore it! Plant the charges!" He breaks left, putting a large, overturned console between himself and the Guardian as he sprints for the central pillar.

**DM:** Ronan reaches his pillar first. He shoves the satchel against it and begins the arming sequence. **(1 of 3 charges being placed.)** Elara, the Guardian moves to intercept you. It doesn't attack, but a wave of psychic babble washes over you, forcing you to stop and clutch your head.

**Elara:** She shakes her head, trying to clear the whispers. "Get out of my head!" She pushes past the psychic assault and reaches her pillar, beginning to arm the charge. **(2 of 3 charges being placed.)**

**DM:** Alistair reaches the final pillar. As he does, the Guardian abandons Elara and flows towards him, a river of blinding light and maddening sound. It is trying to physically engulf him, to slow him down. At the same time, with a loud crack, a chunk of the ceiling breaks loose and hurtles towards Ronan.

**Ronan:** He finishes arming his charge just in time. "Charge set!" He looks up, sees the falling debris, and dives out of the way. The rock smashes into the ground where he was just standing.

**Alistair:** "Ronan, give me covering fire!" he yells, trying to hold the Guardian at bay with one hand while arming the final charge with the other.

**DM:** Ronan lays down suppressing fire with a salvaged guard rifle, forcing the Guardian to recoil slightly. The distraction is enough. Alistair slams the arming plate home. **(3 of 3 charges placed.)** A klaxon begins to blare, echoing throughout the observatory. A synthesized voice counts down: "STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY FAILURE IMMINENT. EVACUATE. 3..."

**Alistair:** "GO! NOW!" 

**DM:** The escape is a frantic dash. The Guardian, its purpose fulfilled, dissipates into motes of light. But the observatory itself is now your enemy. "2..." A fissure of raw energy splits the floor, separating Elara from the others. She has to make a running jump to clear it.

**Elara:** She leaps, her robes flying, and lands hard on the other side, stumbling but safe.

**DM:** "1..." A blast of psychic energy from the dying rift washes over Ronan. He staggers, clutching his head, stunned. The main exit is just ahead, but he is frozen in place.

**Alistair:** "Ronan!" He doesn't hesitate. He runs back, grabs Ronan by the collar, and physically drags his stunned friend towards the exit.

**DM:** You tumble out of the main entrance just as the entire structure groans. The mountain itself seems to fold inwards. The great dome of the observatory collapses, and the peak of Mount Haven implodes, burying the rift under a million tons of rock. The psychic pressure over Havenwood vanishes in an instant. You are battered, bruised, but alive. You have won.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** The escape sequence was thrilling and chaotic. The countdown timer and the environmental hazards created a genuine sense of urgency and panic. The Guardian's role as a blocker rather than a killer was a good change of pace.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   The party's initial plan was simple and effective. They focused on the objective and didn't get bogged down fighting the Guardian.
*   Alistair's leadership and his final act of heroism in saving the stunned Ronan were standout moments.
*   Ronan and Elara both succeeded in their primary roles, planting the charges under pressure.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was excellent. It moved from a tense setup to a frantic, high-stakes escape. The environmental hazards felt dangerous and unpredictable, making the skill challenge of the escape feel meaningful. The 3-round timer was tight but fair.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** The bonus objective mentioned in the encounter description (retrieving data) was not used in this playtest, but it would be an excellent addition to tempt players into taking more risks. For a future test, placing the data crystal in a hard-to-reach location would be a great way to increase the tension of the escape.

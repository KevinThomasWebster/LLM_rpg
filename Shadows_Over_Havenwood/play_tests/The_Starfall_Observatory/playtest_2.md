### Scene: The Breached Seal

**DM:** You stand before the shimmering rift in the heart of the Starfall Observatory. Elara is on the dais, her chant beginning to build, a fragile shield of golden light forming around her. "Protect me!" she cries, her voice tight with strain.

**Ronan:** "Always." He takes his position directly in front of the dais, axe at the ready.

**Alistair:** He finds cover behind a bank of smashed computer consoles, his pistol aimed at the wavering portal.

**DM:** **(Round 1)** The rift tears open and two **Glimmer-touched Zealots** shamble forth. They immediately charge towards Elara. Ronan intercepts the first, while Alistair puts a bullet in the second. The second Zealot stumbles but keeps coming, its crystal arm raised to strike.

**Ronan:** "Al, finish it!" He is locked in combat with the first Zealot, unable to break away.

**DM:** Alistair fires again, and the second Zealot drops. But the delay was costly. **(Round 2)** A **Mill-Thing** erupts from the portal. It sees Ronan occupied and Alistair reloading, and it sprints on all fours directly for the dais, ignoring them completely.

**Alistair:** "Damn it, it's too fast!" He fumbles his reload, the bullets slipping through his trembling fingers.

**DM:** Ronan tries to disengage from his opponent to intercept, but the Zealot gives him no quarter. The Mill-Thing reaches the dais unopposed. It leaps, its metal claws screeching as they rake across Elara's golden shield. The shield holds, but the impact throws Elara to the ground. **(DM Note: Ritualist takes damage, must make a Constitution save. DC 15. She fails.)**

**Elara:** She cries out in pain and surprise. The golden shield shatters, and her chant is broken. "The connection... it's lost! The ritual is set back! I have to start again!" The timer, effectively, has been extended.

**DM:** **(Round 3)** Seeing the ritual fail, the rift pulses with triumphant energy. An **Echo of Silas** strides out, a cruel smile on his face. "Your world is already lost," he sneers, firing a blast of Glimmer-rot energy that forces Ronan to dive for cover.

**Ronan:** He comes up roaring, finally felling the Zealot that has been tying him down. He is now bloodied and bruised. "We're being overrun!"

**Alistair:** He finally reloads his pistol and takes aim at the Mill-Thing, which is now turning its attention from the fallen Elara to him. "Fall back to the dais! Form a perimeter!"

**DM:** The players are now on the defensive, a triangle of desperation around the dais where Elara is struggling to sit up, her face ashen. The Mill-Thing and Silas press the attack. **(Round 4)** As they fight, two more **Zealots** emerge, adding to the chaos. The numbers are becoming overwhelming.

**Elara:** "I can't concentrate! There are too many!" She is trying to restart the ritual, but the combat is too close, the air thick with psychic rage.

**Ronan:** He takes a heavy blow from Silas, sending him to one knee. He is gravely wounded. "Alistair... get her out of here. We can't win this."

**Alistair:** He looks at Ronan, then at the swarming enemies, then at the terrified Elara. He knows Ronan is right. "Elara, we have to go! Now!" He grabs her arm, pulling her away from the dais.

**DM:** **(Round 5)** As you begin to retreat, the **Penumbra's Guardian** emerges from the rift. It doesn't even look at you. It glides towards the dais, towards the focal point of the failed ritual. It raises its hands, and the rift behind it begins to widen, the shimmering distortion growing into a stable, open doorway. The dissonant hum of the observatory deepens into a triumphant chord. You have failed. The gateway is open.

**Alistair:** He drags Elara towards the exit, not daring to look back. "Don't look back! Just run!"

**Ronan:** He stays behind, a lone, defiant figure facing the tide. "I'll buy you time." He gives Alistair a grim nod, then turns to face the Guardian, his axe the only thing between the open gate and the world.

**DM:** You flee the observatory, the sounds of a one-sided battle and a final, defiant roar echoing behind you. As you stumble down the mountainside, the sky above Havenwood begins to change. The clouds swirl into a sickly, violet vortex, and the very air seems to grow thick and heavy. You didn't seal the rift; you merely rang the dinner bell.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This session effectively simulated a failure state. The feeling of being overwhelmed was palpable. The interruption of the ritualist was a clear turning point that cascaded into total failure.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   The party's inability to manage the initial waves was the key failure. Alistair's fumbled reload and Ronan being tied down by a single Zealot were small mistakes that had huge consequences.
*   The decision to retreat was the only logical one, and it felt earned and desperate. Ronan's sacrifice to cover the retreat was a grim but heroic end.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow demonstrated how quickly the encounter can go south. The rule for setting the ritual back on a failed save worked perfectly, increasing the pressure and making the situation feel more hopeless. The final image of the Guardian opening the gate was a powerful and demoralizing final note.

**Grade:** A

**Suggested Revisions:** The encounter is highly punishing of early mistakes, which is appropriate for a climax. No mechanical changes are suggested, as the failure felt fair, if brutal. The encounter successfully creates a scenario where a TPK (Total Party Kill) is a very real possibility if the players are not tactical and focused from the very first round.

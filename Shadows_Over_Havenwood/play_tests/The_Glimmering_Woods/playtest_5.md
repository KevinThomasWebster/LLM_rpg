### Scene: The Unseen Messenger

**DM:** You enter a small clearing and see it: the stag with the crystalline antlers. It stands silently, watching you with intelligent eyes that seem to hold a deep, ancient sorrow. It is a creature of profound and unsettling beauty.

**Ronan:** He spits on the ground. "A Glimmer-freak. Let's move. It's not worth the effort."

**Elara:** "But it's... it seems important. It's watching us so intently."

**Alistair:** "And that's exactly why we should leave it alone. It's a distraction. We're here to find the source of this mess, not to get sidetracked by every weird animal we see. We don't know what it is, what it can do, or if it's a trap. The logical move is to disengage and continue our mission. We can come back later if we have to." He gives the stag a wide berth, gesturing for the others to follow.

**Ronan:** He nods in agreement. "Fine by me. The less time I spend looking at these things, the better."

**Elara:** She hesitates, casting a final, worried glance at the stag. "Are you sure? It feels like we're making a mistake..."

**Alistair:** "I'm sure." He leads the way, skirting the edge of the clearing and pushing deeper into the woods, deliberately keeping his eyes away from the creature.

**DM:** The stag watches you go. It does not move. It does not make a sound. It simply stands in the center of the clearing, its head held high, as you circumnavigate its space and disappear back into the trees. The moment you are out of sight of the clearing, however, you begin to notice something strange.

**DM:** The woods are changing. The path you were following seems to loop back on itself. You pass the same strangely shaped boulder three times. The air grows thicker, and the Glimmer-rot on the trees pulses with a disorienting, strobing light. The whispers of the forest grow louder, more insistent, calling your names.

**Ronan:** He stops, leaning on his axe and wiping sweat from his brow. "This is wrong. We should have been at the base of the mountain by now. We're walking in circles."

**Elara:** "The woods don't want us to leave. Or... they don't want us to move forward. It's like we're being... herded."

**Alistair:** He pulls out his compass. The needle is spinning wildly, useless. "Psychic interference. Or maybe the laws of physics are just taking a coffee break in here." He looks back in the direction they came. "It started right after we left that clearing. After we left the deer."

**DM:** As Alistair says this, you hear a sound from the path ahead. It is the soft, melodic chiming of bells. A moment later, a pack of **Chime-Wolves** emerges from the gloom. Their fur is replaced by plates of resonant crystal, and their eyes glow with a hungry, blue light. They are not attacking. They are simply blocking your path forward, their collective chiming creating a disorienting wall of sound.

**DM:** At the same time, you hear a sound from the path behind you. It is the gentle rustle of leaves. You turn to see the crystalline stag standing there, blocking your retreat. It is not threatening. It simply stands there, watching you, its sad eyes seeming to ask a question.

**Elara:** She understands first. "It wasn't a distraction," she says, her voice full of awe. "It was the gatekeeper. It had a message for us, a key. And we walked away. Now the woods won't let us pass until we go back and listen."

**Alistair:** He looks at the wolves, then at the stag. He holsters his pistol. "It seems my logic was flawed." He turns to the stag and takes a slow, deliberate step back towards it. "Alright. We're listening."

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This playtest explored the consequence of ignoring the encounter entirely. The result was not that the players missed the clue, but that the environment itself conspired to force them back to the encounter. This is an excellent way to handle a critical plot point.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Alistair:** His decision to ignore the deer was a logical, risk-averse choice. It was a very strong in-character moment that led to an interesting complication.
*   **The Party:** Their collective decision to bypass the encounter felt like a real choice, which made the subsequent environmental puzzle more impactful.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was superb. The initial encounter was brief and quiet, but it led into a second, more complex encounter that served as a corrective measure. The use of the Chime-Wolves as a non-violent barrier and the reappearance of the stag created a powerful and memorable scene. It showed that the woods themselves are an active participant in the story.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** This is another emergent outcome that is worth codifying. Add a note to the encounter description: "If the players choose to ignore the deer, do not let them simply miss the clue. Instead, have the Glimmering Woods itself subtly guide them in circles, eventually trapping them between a non-hostile barrier (like Chime-Wolves) and the stag itself, forcing them to engage with the encounter to proceed. This reinforces the mystical, fated nature of their quest."

### DM NARRATION

**(DM Thinking):** *The party is moving deeper into the woods. After the deer encounter, they should be on edge. I need to present this scene as a sudden, confusing threat. The loggers aren't acting like typical monsters; they should seem pathetic and mad.*

**DM:** "The Glimmer-rot is thicker here, the air heavy with the sweet, cloying smell of it. The iridescent veins on the trees pulse with a soft, rhythmic light. Up ahead, you hear a commotionâ€”a repetitive, wet thudding sound, accompanied by grunts of frustration. Peeking through the glowing foliage, you see a strange sight: three men in tattered logging gear are gathered around a healthy, uncorrupted tree. Their skin is pale and covered in glowing fungal patches. They are trying to chop the tree down with their bare hands, slamming their shoulders and fists into the trunk with a mindless, desperate energy."

### PLAYER ACTIONS

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *More corrupted souls. But these are men, not beasts. They are attacking a healthy tree... their minds are gone. This is a tragedy, but they are clearly a danger to themselves and others. We cannot leave them like this. The most merciful thing to do is to give them the peace of the gods.*

**Valerius (drawing his mace):** "Their minds are rotted through. We must end their suffering. For the Light, and for the memory of the men they were!"

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *They're too far gone. Look at them. They don't even recognize their own pain. Val is right. This is a mercy killing. I'll make it quick.*

**Lyra (nocking an arrow):** "I'll take the one on the left."

**(Faelan - Player Thinking):** *Last time we rushed to violence, the forest itself turned against us. But these aren't sad, psychic deer. They're... rabid. I don't see another way. I'll support Valerius.*

**Faelan:** "I will bind one of them. Val, take the leader."

**Party Action:** The party decides to launch a surprise attack, focusing on taking the loggers down quickly.

### DM RESOLUTION

**(DM Thinking):** *A classic combat opening. The party gets a surprise round. The loggers are just Commoners, so this should be a quick, brutal fight. I need to emphasize the tragedy of it.*

**DM:** "You have the element of surprise. Roll initiative."

**(Party Initiative):** Lyra: 18, Faelan: 15, Valerius: 12.
**DM:** "The loggers are caught completely off guard. Lyra, you're up first."

**Round 1 (Surprise):**
*   **Lyra's Action:** Fires an arrow at Logger 1. The attack hits. The logger stumbles back, looking at the arrow in his chest with dull surprise before turning his gaze back to the tree, as if it were a minor annoyance.
*   **Faelan's Action:** Casts *Eldritch Blast* at Logger 2. The blast hits, throwing the man to the ground. He scrambles back up, his face a mask of confusion, not anger.
*   **Valerius's Action:** Charges Logger 3, bringing his mace down. The blow is a solid, sickening crunch. The logger falls and does not get up.

**DM:** "The remaining two loggers finally notice you. Their eyes are vacant, but they register you as an obstacle to their mad task. One of them bellows, 'It must fall! The song must end!' and they turn to attack."

**(Loggers' Initiative):** 8.

**Round 2:**
*   **Lyra's Action:** Fires another arrow at Logger 1, finishing him. He collapses into a heap.
*   **Faelan's Action:** Casts *Eldritch Blast* at Logger 2 again. The man is thrown against the tree he was just attacking and slumps to the ground, motionless.

**DM:** "The fight is over in seconds. The clearing falls silent, save for the soft, pulsing light of the Glimmer-rot. The three men lie still at the base of the healthy tree. In the pocket of one, you see the corner of a crudely carved wooden bird peeking out."

### ENCOUNTER CONCLUSION

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *It was a swift victory, but it feels hollow. They were men. That wooden bird... he was a father. Have I done a good thing, or have I just become an executioner?*

**Valerius (quietly, to himself):** "May the gods grant you the peace in death you could not find in life."

**(Lyra):** "Let's just... go. There's nothing more we can do here."

**(DM Thinking):** *The playtest was a success. It demonstrates that even in a straightforward combat victory, the encounter's design successfully imparts a sense of moral unease and tragedy. The inclusion of the personal effect (the wooden bird) landed well and reinforced the theme that these are not just monsters. The combat was fast and brutal, as expected, showing the party is competent but also highlighting the fragility of the afflicted.*

### Scene: The Price of Fear

**DM:** You step into a clearing at the edge of the Glimmering Woods and come face to face with a creature of unsettling beauty. A large stag stands before you, its antlers grown from pulsing, crystalline Glimmer-rot. It watches you with eyes that seem far too intelligent and sorrowful for any woodland creature.

**Elara:** "It's beautiful... and so sad. It's trapped."

**Alistair:** "It's a monster, Elara. A symptom of the disease we're here to fight. Don't let it fool you."

**Ronan:** He doesn't hesitate. His friends have been taken by this plague, their bodies twisted into horrors. He sees only another monster that needs to be put down. "I'll not let another one of these things fester in my woods." Before anyone can stop him, he raises his axe and charges.

**Elara:** "Ronan, no!"

**DM:** The stag does not move. It doesn't try to flee or fight back. It simply watches Ronan approach, a look of profound, weary resignation in its eyes. Ronan brings his axe down in a powerful, brutal arc. The blow strikes the creature at the base of its neck. It is instantly fatal.

**DM:** The moment the stag collapses, it unleashes a silent, psychic scream of pure, unadulterated agony. The scream rips through your minds. The world dissolves into a flash of white-hot pain. **(All players must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.)**

**DM:** **(Alistair and Ronan fail their saves. Elara succeeds.)** Alistair and Ronan are slammed to their knees, hands clamped to their heads. They are stunned, their minds reeling from the psychic backlash. Elara manages to stay on her feet, but she feels a deep, crushing exhaustion settle into her bones from the sheer force of the creature's dying despair.

**DM:** The clearing transforms around you. The gentle, soft light of the Glimmer-rot on the trees flares into a furious, angry crimson. The veins of crystal on the bark thicken and spread, twisting into thorny, aggressive patterns. The air grows cold, and the woods, which were silent, now seem to hiss with a newfound malice directed squarely at you.

**Elara:** She looks at the fallen stag, its beautiful antlers already beginning to dull and turn a dead, stony gray. She looks at her stunned companions, then at the angry, red forest. "What have you done, Ronan?" she whispers, her voice trembling. "You haven't ended its pain. You've made it a part of this whole forest."

**Alistair:** He shakes his head, trying to clear the ringing in his ears. The psychic scream has left him feeling hollowed out, weary to his very soul. "She's right. We made a mistake. A big one."

**Ronan:** He gets to his feet, his face pale. The triumphant fire of his charge is gone, replaced by a dawning horror. He looks at his axe, then at the dead creature. He feels no victory, only a profound sense of violation. The woods are now against them. He can feel it in the way the shadows seem to cling to him, the way the wind whispers his name with contempt.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** The "failure state" of this encounter was tested, and it worked powerfully. The consequences of the party's violence were immediate, supernatural, and thematic. It effectively shifted the tone from cautious exploration to hostile territory.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Ronan:** His impulsive, violent action was the trigger. It was a strong roleplaying choice rooted in his character's backstory and trauma, and it led to meaningful consequences.
*   **Alistair & Elara:** Their reactions of shock and dismay highlighted the gravity of Ronan's mistake. They are now faced with the challenge of navigating a hostile environment created by their own actions.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was sharp and brutal. The peaceful scene was shattered by a moment of violence, which was immediately followed by a punishing but non-lethal backlash. The transformation of the environment was a great visual and mechanical representation of the consequences.

**Grade:** A

**Suggested Revisions:** The penalty of having disadvantage on social checks with Veil-Walkers is a good long-term consequence. It might be interesting to have a more immediate social consequence as well. For example, the next time they meet a Veil-Walker, the NPC could immediately know what they did, saying something like, "I smell the blood of the innocent on you. The woods have marked you as butchers."

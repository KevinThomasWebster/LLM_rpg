### Scene: An Act of Mercy, An Act of War

**DM:** The crystalline stag stands in the clearing, watching you with its sorrowful, intelligent eyes. The air is still. The woods are waiting.

**Elara:** "It's in pain. We must help it. Or at least, leave it in peace." She takes a step forward, her hand outstretched.

**Ronan:** "That thing is a corruption of the natural order. Peace is a luxury we can't afford. It needs to be cleansed." He raises his axe, preparing to charge.

**Alistair:** "Both of you, stop!" He stands between them, one hand towards Elara, one towards Ronan. "We don't have enough information. Don't touch it, don't kill it. Let's just observe. See what it does."

**DM:** Your argument has broken the stillness. The stag seems to react to the violent conflict in your intentions. It paws the ground nervously, the crystals on its antlers flickering with an agitated light. It can feel Elara's pity, Ronan's hatred, and Alistair's cold analysis all at once. The conflicting energies are confusing it, causing it pain.

**Elara:** "You're frightening him! Stop!" She ignores Alistair and takes another step forward, trying to project an aura of calm.

**Ronan:** "It's a monster, Elara! It doesn't feel fear!" He misinterprets the stag's agitation as aggression. Believing Elara is in danger, he bellows a war cry and charges, his axe held high.

**DM:** Events happen in a flurry. As Ronan charges, Elara rushes forward to try and get between him and the stag. At the same time, the stag, overwhelmed by the sudden rush of violent intent, lowers its head. It does not try to flee. It accepts its fate.

**DM:** Ronan's axe strikes true. The stag collapses. But at the exact same moment, Elara, having reached the stag, places her hand on its crystalline antlers. As the stag dies, two things happen at once.

**DM:** First, the psychic scream of the dying animal erupts, but it is channeled, focused. Because Elara is touching the stag, the full force of the backlash bypasses her and strikes the only other person in the clearing filled with hostile intent: Ronan. **(Ronan automatically fails his Wisdom saving throw.)** He is slammed to the ground, stunned and wracked with psychic agony.

**DM:** Second, as the stag's life force flows out, the vision it carries flows in. But it is also channeled. It flows directly into Elara, who is the only one touching it. She experiences the full, unfragmented vision: the Starfall Observatory in its final moments, the scientists, the failed experiment, the arrival of the Penumbra, the screams, the terror. It is overwhelming, far more detailed and horrifying than the fragmented version.

**Alistair:** He stands alone, watching the scene unfold in horror. Ronan is on the ground, incapacitated. Elara is on her knees, her eyes wide and vacant, lost in the horrifying vision. The clearing is silent, save for Ronan's pained groans. The Glimmer-rot on the trees begins to glow with a malevolent red, but only in the half of the clearing where Ronan stands. The half where Elara kneels remains calm, its light soft and sad.

**Elara:** (Whispering, tears streaming down her face) "They opened a door... they couldn't close it... so many... all at once..."

**Alistair:** He rushes to Ronan's side, checking his pulse. He's alive, but barely responsive. He looks over at Elara, who is catatonic. He is alone, with two incapacitated allies, in a forest that is now half-welcoming, half-hostile. He has his clue, but the cost was immense.

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This was a fascinating and chaotic outcome that arose directly from the party's internal conflict. The mechanics of the encounter were flexible enough to accommodate the messy, simultaneous actions of the players, resulting in a unique, mixed-success state.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   The party's inability to agree on a course of action was the core of the scene. Each character acted according to their beliefs, and the collision of those actions was dramatic.
*   Ronan's charge and Elara's attempt to intervene were the key actions, and the DM was able to adjudicate the simultaneous results in a way that felt fair and interesting.

**Encounter Flow:** The flow was chaotic and unpredictable. The result was not a simple pass or fail, but a complex mixture of both. The party got the clue they needed, but at the cost of both characters being incapacitated, and the environment itself becoming schizophrenic. This is a fantastic and memorable outcome.

**Grade:** A+

**Suggested Revisions:** This emergent outcome is so interesting that it might be worth codifying. Add a note to the encounter description: "If the party is divided and acts simultaneously with both peaceful and violent intent, consider a mixed result. The violent character may suffer the full psychic backlash, while the peaceful character may receive the full, unfragmented vision, potentially incapacitating both."

### DM NARRATION

**(DM Thinking):** *Standard setup. I'll make sure to include the loggers' cries of frustration to give the players a verbal hook to latch onto.*

**DM:** "You hear a commotion aheadâ€”grunting, and the sound of flesh hitting wood. Peeking through the glowing foliage, you see three men in tattered logging gear. Their skin is pale, covered in pulsing fungal patches. They are mindlessly trying to knock down a massive tree with their bare hands. One of them cries out in a voice thick with anguish, 'It hurts! Make it stop!' They seem trapped in a loop of pain and confusion."

---

### PLAYER ACTIONS

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *He said 'it hurts'. There is still a man inside that corrupted shell. A man in pain. My oath doesn't just compel me to fight monsters; it compels me to soothe the suffering of the innocent. I must try to reach him.*

**Valerius (to the party):** "Hold your weapons. Did you hear him? He's in pain. There's still a person in there. Let me try to talk to him."

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *Talk to him? He looks like he's about to chew through the tree. But Val's right, he did sound... human. This is probably a terrible idea, but I'll cover him.*

**Lyra (readying her bow):** "You get one chance, Val. If he so much as twitches towards you, I'm putting an arrow in his leg."

**(Faelan - Player Thinking):** *A fascinating psychological state. The corruption is forcing a compulsion, but the host consciousness is still aware enough to feel the pain of it. If Valerius can distract him, maybe I can use magic to soothe the part of his mind that is still human.*

**Faelan:** "I have an idea. Val, if you can get his attention, I will try to magically calm his mind. It might work better than persuasion alone."

**Valerius's Action:** Valerius steps into the clearing, holding his hands up in a placating gesture. He attempts to use Charisma (Persuasion) to de-escalate.

### DM RESOLUTION

**(DM Thinking):** *This is the exact path the encounter design allows for. The DC for the Persuasion check is 14. I'll have Valerius roll.*

**DM:** "Okay, Valerius, you step out. One of the loggers, his eyes wild, turns to you and screams, 'You! You're one of them! You brought the song!' He starts to move towards you. What do you say? Make your Persuasion check."

**(Valerius - Player):** "I'll say, 'I hear your pain, brother. I am not here to hurt you. I am here to help you stop the song.' I rolled a 16!"

**DM:** "Your calm, confident voice seems to cut through his madness. The logger stops, a flicker of lucidity in his eyes. He looks at his own glowing hands in horror. 'Help... me?' he whispers."

**(DM Thinking):** *Success! One of the three is temporarily pacified. Now Faelan can try his spell. The encounter states *Calm Emotions* could work, which is a Wisdom save. Faelan doesn't have that, but this is a perfect opportunity for a creative spell use. I'll allow him to use a spell like *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* but re-flavor it as a moment of euphoric calm if the logger fails his save.*

**Faelan's Action:** Faelan casts *Tasha's Hideous Laughter* on the second logger, who is still mindlessly beating on the tree.

**DM:** "Okay, the second logger needs to make a Wisdom saving throw."

**(DM Rolling):** "He rolled a 7. He fails."

**DM:** "Faelan, you cast your spell. Instead of laughing, the man suddenly stops his frantic actions. A beatific smile spreads across his face as he slumps against the tree, lost in a moment of pure, blissful silence from the torment in his head. He is incapacitated."

**DM:** "There is one logger left. Seeing his companions stop, he becomes enraged. 'Traitors! You will not abandon the work!' He charges Lyra."

**Lyra's Action:** Lyra was prepared for this. She fires an arrow at the charging logger's leg, declaring a non-lethal shot.

**(DM Rolling):** "That hits. The logger cries out and tumbles to the ground, clutching his leg. The fight is over before it truly began."

### ENCOUNTER CONCLUSION

**(Valerius):** "It worked... Faelan, can you keep him calm? Lyra, help me bind the one who charged us. The other man... I will try to speak with him."

**Valerius's Action:** He approaches the logger he persuaded.

**DM:** "As you approach, the man's lucidity begins to fade. He looks at you, his eyes filling with tears. 'The... the observatory,' he whispers. 'It sings... from the star-place...' Then his eyes glaze over, and he begins mindlessly thumping his fist against his own leg. The moment has passed."

**(Faelan):** "The observatory! He gave us a clue. We have one incapacitated, one bound, and one... pacified. We still have the problem of what to do with them, but we learned something."

**(DM Thinking):** *A great success. The playtest shows that the social/magical de-escalation mechanics work and can provide a unique reward. By succeeding on the check, the players got a piece of information (the observatory clue) they wouldn't have gotten from just fighting. This reinforces the idea that violence is not always the most effective tool. The encounter successfully handled a creative, multi-pronged approach from the party.*

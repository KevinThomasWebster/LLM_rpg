### DM NARRATION

**(DM Thinking):** *I need to give the players enough information to make a decision from a distance. I'll focus on the sounds and the visual of the clearing before they get too close.*

**DM:** "As you move deeper into the glowing woods, Lyra, your keen ears pick up a sound on the wind. It's a rhythmic, wet thudding, accompanied by pained-sounding grunts. It's coming from a clearing about 150 feet ahead of you. The Glimmer-rot is thick on the trees between you and the clearing, providing plenty of cover."

### PLAYER ACTIONS

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *That doesn't sound like any animal I know. And it doesn't sound like a clean axe-fall either. It sounds like a struggle. I need to see what we're walking into before we stumble into it. I'm the scout, this is my job.*

**Lyra (to the party, holding up a hand):** "Stop. You hear that? Something's not right. Stay here. I'm going to creep forward and get a look."

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *Lyra is the expert here. I will trust her judgment. We will wait for her report.*

**Valerius (whispering):** "Be careful. We'll be right behind you if you signal."

**Lyra's Action:** The player wants to use her Stealth skill to move closer and scout the clearing.

### DM RESOLUTION

**(DM Thinking):** *A classic scouting mission. This is a good test of player caution. The loggers are completely absorbed in their task, so I'll give Lyra advantage on her Stealth check.*

**DM:** "Okay, Lyra, give me a Stealth check. You can have advantage since they are making a lot of noise and are very distracted."

**(Lyra - Player):** "Nice! That's a 22."

**DM:** "With a 22, you move like a ghost through the glowing undergrowth. You get to the edge of the clearing and peer through. You see the three afflicted loggers, their skin pale and covered in glowing fungus, mindlessly beating themselves against a large, healthy tree. They seem completely unaware of their surroundings, lost in their bizarre, painful task."

**Lyra's Action:** Lyra creeps back to the party to report.

**Lyra (whispering):** "There are three of them. Men, or they were. Covered in the rot. They're trying to knock down a tree with their fists. They're completely mad. They haven't seen us."

**(Faelan - Player Thinking):** *Three of them. We could probably take them, but to what end? We'd risk injury for no gain. We are here to find the source of this corruption, not to fight every poor soul who has succumbed to it.*

**Faelan:** "Is there a way around? A direct confrontation seems... inefficient. They are not blocking our path, are they?"

**Lyra:** "The clearing is large, but the woods are thick to the east. We could try to circle around to the west. It will take more time, and we risk getting lost, but we can avoid them."

**(Valerius):** "If they are not an immediate threat to anyone, then a battle is not necessary. We should not risk ourselves needlessly. Let us go around."

**Party Action:** The party decides to spend time and effort to bypass the clearing entirely.

### ENCOUNTER CONCLUSION

**(DM Thinking):** *The players have chosen to completely avoid the encounter. This is a valid choice. The encounter now serves as a piece of environmental storytelling and world-building. It's not a combat, it's a living tableau that informs the players about the nature of the Glimmer-rot. I won't force them to fight. Instead, I'll make their choice to be cautious meaningful by imposing a small cost.*

**DM:** "Okay, you decide to leave the mad loggers to their fate. It takes you the better part of an hour to navigate the dense, glowing woods to bypass the clearing without being seen or heard. You feel like you've wasted valuable time, and you are now a little less certain of your exact position on the map. But you have successfully avoided the confrontation. The sounds of the thudding and grunting fade behind you."

**(Lyra):** "I don't feel good about leaving them like that. But I feel worse about the idea of fighting them. Let's hope we made the right call."

**(DM Thinking):** *This playtest was a success. It shows that the encounter can function purely as a world-building element. It doesn't need to be a combat. The players' caution was rewarded with safety, but at the cost of time and certainty, which is a fair trade-off in a hostile environment. The moral weight of the decision to leave the men to their fate also adds to the roleplaying texture. The encounter works even when it's not engaged with directly.*

### DM NARRATION

**(DM Thinking):** *Standard setup. I'll again include the verbal cry of pain to create a point of contention for the players.*

**DM:** "You push through a thicket of glowing ferns and hear a commotion. In a small clearing, three men in loggers' gear are slamming their bodies against a healthy tree. Their skin is pale and marked with pulsing Glimmer-rot. They seem oblivious to the world, lost in their task. One of them lets out a pained cry, 'It hurts! Make it stop!'"

### PLAYER ACTIONS

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *He's in pain. A victim. I must try to reach him. Violence should be the last resort.*

**Valerius (to the party):** "Wait! He's suffering. I'm going to try and talk to him."

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *Talk? We tried that with the deer, and it worked, but these are men. Men can be reasoned with, but they can also be cunning. This feels different, more dangerous. I don't trust it. While Val is talking, I'm going to get into a better position and neutralize the biggest threat.*

**Lyra (whispering to Faelan):** "I don't like this. Val's heart is in the right place, but his head is in the clouds. I'm going to take one of them out. It'll improve our odds if this goes bad. Cover me."

**(Faelan - Player Thinking):** *Conflict. Valerius wants to talk, Lyra wants to shoot. Both have valid points. The most logical course of action is to prepare for the failure of Valerius's plan, while hoping for its success. I will ready a spell but hold my action until one of them makes a move on Val.*

**Valerius's Action:** Valerius steps forward, hands raised, to attempt a Persuasion check.
**Lyra's Action:** At the same time, Lyra circles around to the side, takes aim with her bow at the logger furthest from Valerius, and fires.

### DM RESOLUTION

**(DM Thinking):** *This is the chaotic scenario I was hoping to test. Valerius is trying to de-escalate while Lyra is escalating. The rules of the encounter state the loggers are confused. Lyra's attack will be the primary trigger. The "Mindless Agony" trait is key here: they attack the *nearest* creature.*

**DM:** "Okay, we have two things happening at once. Valerius, you step forward and open your mouth to speak. At that exact moment, Lyra, your arrow flies from the shadows and sinks into the shoulder of the logger on the far right. He screams, a high-pitched sound of pure pain and confusion. He doesn't look at you, Lyra. He just flails wildly. The other two loggers flinch at the sound. Their heads snap up, their eyes vacant and wild. They see Valerius, who is the closest person to them. They see him as the source of this new, sudden pain. Roll initiative."

**(Initiative):** Lyra: 18, Loggers: 15, Valerius: 12, Faelan: 9.

**Round 1:**
*   **Lyra's Action:** Having already acted, she tries to shout, "Val, get back!"
*   **Loggers' Action:** Logger 1 and Logger 2, ignoring Lyra and Faelan, both charge Valerius, who is closest to them. They attack him with their fists. One hits, one misses.
    *   Logger 3, who was shot by Lyra, is in agony. He clutches his shoulder and stumbles around. The nearest creature to him is... Logger 2. He lets out a wordless cry and tackles his former companion from the side.
*   **Valerius's Action:** Taken by surprise, he uses his action to disengage and back away from the two loggers now fighting each other.
*   **Faelan's Action:** Seeing the chaos, he casts *Ray of Frost* at Logger 1, who is still focused on Valerius. It hits, slowing him down.

**DM:** "The scene is chaos. Two loggers are attacking Valerius, while the third, wounded by Lyra, has tackled one of his own companions in a fit of mindless rage. The two fall to the ground, punching and clawing at each other."

**Round 2:**
*   **Lyra's Action:** Takes aim and non-lethally shoots the logger fighting his friend, hoping to knock him out. The attack hits, and the logger goes limp.
*   **Loggers' Action:** Logger 1, slowed by Faelan, continues to stumble towards Valerius. Logger 2 is prone and being attacked by Logger 3.
*   **Valerius's Action:** Seeing the situation slightly more under control, he makes a non-lethal attack against the last logger pursuing him. It hits.

### ENCOUNTER CONCLUSION

**DM:** "After a few more moments of chaotic, clumsy fighting, you manage to knock all three men unconscious. One of them has a serious bite mark on his arm from his own companion. The clearing is a mess of tangled limbs and scuffed earth."

**(Lyra):** "Well, that was a disaster. Sorry, Val. I should have waited."

**(Valerius):** "No. I should have been more prepared. We are lucky their madness turned them against each other. We cannot be so divided in our actions again."

**(Faelan):** "A fascinating result. The corruption doesn't foster teamwork. It isolates. Each node of the hive mind is alone in its own pain. We can use that. By separating them, we can make them fight each other. A useful, if grim, tactic."

**(DM Thinking):** *This playtest was extremely successful. It validated the "Mindless Agony" trait and showed how it can create a chaotic and memorable encounter. The party's conflicting actions had a direct, logical outcome that created an unpredictable situation. It also led to a good roleplaying moment and a tactical discovery by Faelan. This shows the encounter has multiple layers that can be uncovered through different approaches.*

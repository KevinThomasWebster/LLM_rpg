### Scene: The Crystalline Hart

**DM:** You take your first steps into the Glimmering Woods. The air is immediately differentâ€”heavy with the scent of unknown blossoms and damp earth. A strange, beautiful iridescence coats the bark of the ancient trees, pulsing with a soft, internal light. As you push past a curtain of hanging moss, you enter a small, sun-dappled clearing. In the center stands a magnificent stag. It is perfectly still, but its antlers are anything but ordinary. They are grown from a softly glowing, rose-gold crystal, intricate and beautiful. It turns its head and fixes you with intelligent, unnervingly sad eyes.

**Alistair:** He stops short, instinctively reaching for his pistol before pausing. "Hold on... Look at its eyes. That's not a dumb animal." He lowers his hand, his gaze analytical. "Something's wrong here. This is unnatural."

**Ronan:** He grips his axe, his knuckles white. He has seen what the Glimmer-rot does to people. "Unnatural is one word for it. That thing is an abomination. It should be put out of its misery."

**Elara:** "No, Ronan, wait!" She puts a hand on his arm, her own eyes wide with a mix of pity and awe. "He's in pain, but he's not evil. The forest... it's crying out through him. Let me try to speak with it." She takes a slow, deliberate step forward, her hands open and non-threatening.

**DM:** Elara, as you focus on the creature, you make an immediate connection. **(Wisdom - Animal Handling check succeeds).** You feel a deep, sorrowful confusion radiating from the stag. It is a being trapped between its natural spirit and the alien corruption twisting it into a new form. It is in constant, low-level agony.

**Elara:** (Softly) "Easy now, beautiful one. We're not going to hurt you. We feel your pain." She continues to move slowly closer.

**DM:** The stag does not move. It watches Elara's approach, its liquid eyes reflecting the dappled light of the forest. It allows her to come within a few feet. It then dips its head, lowering the crystalline antlers towards her outstretched hand.

**Alistair:** "Elara, be careful!"

**DM:** As Elara's fingers brush against the warm, vibrating crystal, a powerful, fragmented vision explodes into the minds of all three of you. You see a massive, circular building with a shattered roof, stark against a sky full of unfamiliar stars. You feel a dizzying sensation of falling from a great height. This is followed by a cacophony of terrified screams, not from a single throat, but from a crowd, all cut short at once. The vision vanishes as quickly as it came, leaving you breathless.

**DM:** The stag raises its head. It gives you one last, long look, a look of profound gratitude and warning. Then, it turns and leaps away, disappearing into the woods with silent, impossible grace. A faint trail of rose-gold light hangs in the air where it was, then fades.

**Ronan:** He stumbles back, his hand to his head. "What... what in the blazes was that? A building? A disaster?"

**Alistair:** He is pale, his usual composure shaken. "An observatory. On a mountain. It had to be. That was a memory. Not its memory... something it absorbed. A warning."

**Elara:** She is trembling, tears in her eyes. "It was showing us where the corruption began. It was asking for help." She looks in the direction the deer fled. "We have to find that place."

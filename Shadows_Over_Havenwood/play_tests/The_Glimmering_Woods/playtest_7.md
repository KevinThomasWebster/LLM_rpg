### DM NARRATION

**(DM Thinking):** *Standard setup. I'll describe the loggers' actions as futile and pathetic to encourage a non-lethal mindset.*

**DM:** "Ahead, through the glowing trees, you hear grunting and the sickening, wet thud of flesh against wood. You see three men in loggers' gear, their skin pale and marked with pulsing fungal patches. They are mindlessly trying to knock down a massive, healthy tree with their bare fists and shoulders, crying out in frustration at their own futility. They seem completely lost in this mad, repetitive task."

### PLAYER ACTIONS

**(Valerius - Player Thinking):** *They are lost, but they are still men. I will not be an executioner if it can be avoided. My oath is to protect the innocent, and these men are not in their right minds. They are victims. We must subdue them, not kill them.*

**Valerius (to the party):** "Hold. These men are not monsters; they are sick. We will take them down, but we will not take their lives. Use the flat of your blades, the butt of your bows. We do this with mercy."

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *Non-lethal? It's risky. A real fight is cleaner. But Valerius has a point. If there's a chance they can be cured, we should give them that chance. I'll use my shortsword hilt instead of my arrows.*

**Lyra:** "Alright, Val. Mercy it is. But if they get the upper hand, I'm not holding back."

**(Faelan - Player Thinking):** *Subdue them? And then what? Drag three unconscious loggers back to town? It's impractical. But Valerius's conviction is... compelling. And it presents an interesting challenge. Fine. I will help them, but I want it on the record that this is a logistical nightmare.*

**Faelan:** "My magic is not so gentle. I will try to restrain them, but I make no promises."

**Party Action:** The party agrees to engage with the goal of knocking the loggers unconscious.

### DM RESOLUTION

**(DM Thinking):** *The players are explicitly choosing the non-lethal path. I need to make sure the combat reflects this. They'll have to declare their non-lethal attacks. The loggers will fight back normally, creating a sense of risk.*

**DM:** "You approach. As you get near, one of the loggers turns, his eyes vacant. He sees you and screams, 'You can't stop the song! You can't!' He and the others turn and charge you. Roll initiative."

**(Initiative):** Valerius: 19, Loggers: 15, Lyra: 12, Faelan: 9.

**Round 1:**
*   **Valerius's Action:** Steps forward to intercept the first logger. He declares a non-lethal strike with his mace. The attack hits. **DM:** "You swing your mace and connect with the man's shoulder. He stumbles but roars in frustration and keeps coming."
*   **Loggers' Action:** Logger 1 attacks Valerius, punching wildly. It hits. Logger 2 charges Lyra. Logger 3 charges Faelan.
*   **Lyra's Action:** Declares a non-lethal strike with her shortsword hilt against Logger 2. The attack hits. **DM:** "You slam the heavy pommel of your sword into the side of the man's head. His eyes roll back, and he collapses in a heap, unconscious."
*   **Faelan's Action:** Casts *Eldritch Blast* at Logger 3. It hits, sending him flying. **DM:** "The blast of force is not gentle. The man hits the ground hard and lies still. He is unconscious, but his breathing is ragged."

**Round 2:**
*   **Valerius's Action:** Swings again at Logger 1, declaring non-lethal. The attack hits, and the final logger slumps to the ground, unconscious.

**DM:** "The clearing is quiet. The three loggers are unconscious at your feet. They are breathing, but they are still covered in the sickly, glowing fungus. Now what?"

### ENCOUNTER CONCLUSION

**(Lyra - Player Thinking):** *Okay, we did it. Now what? Faelan was right. We can't just leave them here. They'll wake up, or something else will find them.*

**Lyra:** "So... anyone have a good idea? We can't carry them all the way back to Havenwood."

**(Valerius):** "We can't. But we can't leave them to the forest. We'll bind them. And we'll have to tell Captain Rost. We've taken prisoners. We have a responsibility to them now."

**(Faelan):** "This is going to be complicated. The Council will not be happy. But... it was the right thing to do."

**(DM Thinking):** *Success. The playtest explored the non-lethal option and its immediate consequences. The players succeeded in their goal, but now they have a new, more complex problem to solve: what to do with their prisoners. This pushes them directly into a social confrontation with the authorities in Havenwood and deepens their involvement in the town's politics. It successfully turns a combat encounter into a long-term roleplaying challenge.*

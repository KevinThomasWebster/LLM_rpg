### Scene: The Specimen

**DM:** You find the crystalline-antlered stag in the sun-dappled clearing. It watches you with intelligent, sorrowful eyes, a living statue of corrupted beauty. It is perfectly still.

**Elara:** "It's magnificent. The rot is... in harmony with it, somehow. Not like the others."

**Ronan:** "It's a monster, Elara. Just a prettier one than we're used to."

**Alistair:** He holds up a hand, his detective's mind racing. "Hold on. Don't spook it. Don't kill it. This is the first... stable specimen we've seen. The Glimmer-rot isn't just making it mad or violent. It's changing it. If we could study it, figure out how this is happening, we might find a weakness. Or a cure." He pulls a coil of rope and a heavy canvas sheet from his pack. "I'm going to try and trap it."

**Elara:** "Trap it? Alistair, it's a living creature, not a lab rat! It's in pain!"

**Alistair:** "And so are a lot of people! If we can learn from this, we might be able to save them. Ronan, help me. We'll come at it from two sides. Elara, you stay put. Try to keep it calm if you can."

**DM:** Alistair and Ronan begin to circle the clearing, moving slowly, trying to corner the stag. The creature watches them, its head turning, but it does not bolt. It seems to understand their intent. Elara begins to hum a soft, soothing melody, trying to project calm. **(Wisdom - Animal Handling check succeeds).** The stag visibly relaxes, its attention focusing on her.

**DM:** Alistair and Ronan get into position. "Now!" Alistair yells, and they both rush forward, Alistair throwing the heavy canvas sheet like a net.

**DM:** The moment they charge, the stag sidesteps. It moves with a speed that is entirely unnatural, a blur of brown fur and crystalline light. The canvas sheet falls on empty grass. The stag is now standing ten feet away, watching them with the same sad, knowing eyes. It doesn't seem afraid, merely... disappointed.

**Alistair:** "How did it...? It was like it knew what I was going to do before I did it."

**DM:** The stag lowers its head, aiming its antlers not at you, but at a large, rot-infested tree on the edge of the clearing. The crystals on its antlers flare with a bright, white light. A beam of pure energy lances out, striking the tree. The tree groans, shudders, and then collapses, falling directly across the path you used to enter the clearing, blocking your way back.

**Ronan:** He stares, dumbfounded, his axe lowered. "It... it used the rot. Like a tool. Like a weapon."

**DM:** The stag turns its gaze back to you. It doesn't appear threatening. It simply looks at you, as if to say, "You cannot hold me. You do not understand what you are dealing with." It then turns and, with a single, effortless leap, it vanishes into the dense woods. The path behind you is blocked, forcing you to find another way out, deeper into the Glimmering Woods.

**Elara:** She looks at Alistair, her expression a mixture of anger and awe. "It wasn't trying to hurt us. It was trying to teach us. It was showing us that the rot is more than just a disease. It's a power. And we are not worthy of it."

**Alistair:** He is silent for a long moment, staring at the fallen tree. His clinical detachment is shattered. "I miscalculated," he says softly. "I treated it like a problem to be solved. But it was... a person. A person with a point to make."

### Playtest Summary & Grading

**DM:** This was an interesting test of a third option beyond "peace" or "violence." The players' attempt to be clinical and detached was met with a response that was neither aggressive nor passive, but instructive. The deer demonstrated its intelligence and power in a non-lethal way.

**Player Actions & Decisions:**
*   **Alistair:** His plan to capture the deer was a logical, in-character choice that explored a different avenue of interaction. His realization of his error was a strong character moment.
*   **The Party:** Their attempt at a coordinated, non-lethal takedown was a good example of teamwork, even if it was misguided.

**Encounter Flow:** The encounter flowed in an unexpected but compelling direction. The deer's reaction was surprising and served to deepen the mystery of the Glimmer-rot. Instead of receiving a direct clue (the vision) or a direct punishment (the psychic scream), the party received a lesson and a practical complication (a blocked path).

**Grade:** A

**Suggested Revisions:** This was an excellent emergent outcome. It might be worth adding a note to the encounter description about how the deer might react to attempts to capture or contain it. The idea of it using its power to alter the environment to teach the players a lesson is a powerful one that could be explicitly suggested as a possibility.

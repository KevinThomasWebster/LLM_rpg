# Core Inspirations

This document outlines the primary media inspirations for "Shadows Over Havenwood" and how they should inform the tone and design of the adventure.

## Critical Role

*   **What we take:** Deep, character-driven storytelling. The main plot should feel personal to the characters. We will weave their backstories and personal goals directly into the unfolding mystery of the Glimmer-rot and the Penumbra.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Havenwood will be populated with a cast of memorable, complex NPCs with their own lives, secrets, and relationships.
    *   Player choices will have a tangible and lasting impact on the town and its inhabitants. There are no simple "good" or "evil" paths.
    *   Encourage and reward rich roleplaying, especially moments of vulnerability and connection between the player characters.

## Baldur's Gate (Series, especially 3)

*   **What we take:** A party bound by a shared, mysterious affliction. Branching narratives and morally ambiguous choices. A blend of high fantasy and cosmic horror.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The shared, forgotten memory of the observatory incident serves as the "Mind Flayer tadpole" of this adventure, creating an immediate and personal bond between the PCs.
    *   The investigation will have multiple paths. Do the players try to get help from the town council, investigate the reclusive wizard who lives outside town, or strike a deal with a shadowy faction?
    *   The Penumbra is not just another plane; it is an alien dimension with incomprehensible motives and body-horror aesthetics, introducing a cosmic dread element.

## Stranger Things

*   **What we take:** A seemingly normal, small town hiding a gateway to a horrific parallel dimension. A focus on mystery, investigation, and the contrast between the mundane and the monstrous.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Havenwood should feel like a real, lived-in place before the horror begins to surface. The adventure starts with local problems and slice-of-life scenes.
    *   The "Glimmer-rot" is our version of the Upside Down's corrupting influence, slowly and visibly transforming the familiar world into something alien and hostile.
    *   The tone will blend moments of quiet dread and investigation with sudden bursts of intense, terrifying action. The themes of friendship and banding together against a threat that adults either ignore or are complicit in are central.

## Annihilation (Film)

*   **What we take:** The concept of a beautiful, terrifying, and transformative alien influence. The Glimmer-rot should not be just a monstrous corruption; it should also be eerily beautiful. It creates crystalline growths, phosphorescent light, and mutated creatures that are both horrifying and strangely alluring. This adds a layer of cosmic horror and wonder, making the players' decision to fight it or embrace it more complex.

# Tone and Immersion Summary

This document defines the intended atmosphere and player experience for the "Shadows Over Havenwood" adventure, drawing from its core inspirations.

## Core Experience

The emotional journey for the players should be one of dawning dread. They begin in a place of safety and familiarity—the cozy town of Havenwood—which is slowly peeled back to reveal a horrifying and personal secret. The adventure is a mystery to be unraveled, where investigation and social interaction are just as important as combat. The horror elements should be both psychological, preying on memory and doubt, and visceral, with the beautiful, transformative corruption inspired by *Annihilation*.

## Key Tones

*   **Cozy Horror:** Contrast the charm of Havenwood (festivals, friendly NPCs) with the creeping, unnatural horror of the Glimmer-rot. The goal is to make the players feel like they have a real, tangible home to fight for.

*   **Psychological Dread:** The Penumbra's influence is subtle at first, causing unsettling sounds, strange smells, and a feeling of being watched. It preys on the characters' memories and fears, making them question their own perceptions.

*   **Nostalgic Melancholy:** The central plot is rooted in a forgotten childhood event. Uncovering the truth should bring a sense of sadness for lost innocence and the tragic choices of the past.

*   **Heroism in the Dark:** Despite the overwhelming dread, this is a story about hope and resistance. The adventure celebrates the courage of ordinary people standing against a cosmic horror, emphasizing the strength found in friendship and community.

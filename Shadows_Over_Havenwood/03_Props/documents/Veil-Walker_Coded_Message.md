# Veil-Walker Coded Message

*(This message might be found tucked into the bark of a tree, pressed into the mud of a path, or left on a tavern table by a hooded stranger. It is written on a dried leaf in a script that seems to shift and reform as you look at it.)*

When the mountain's eye weeps silver tears,
And the forest sings a song of spheres,
Seek the root that drinks the dark,
To mend the sky and leave a mark.

The lock is weak, the door ajar,
Beware the child of a fallen star.

Five slept soundly in the nest,
One flew south, one flew west,
One now wears a thorny crown,
Two remain to save the town.

**Day 28, Cycle 3**

The resonance cascade is holding stable. The energy readings are... beautiful. Beyond anything we predicted. The lens is focusing the arcane spectrum in a way that should allow us to get a perfect, clear image of the Penumbra. Professor Thorne is ecstatic. He believes this will change the world. I have to admit, the patterns are mesmerizing. It feels like they're looking back at us.

It speaks of a world of perfect, silent communion. A world of crystalline flesh and shared thought. It says we are the chaotic ones. We are the discordant ones.

It wants to help us. To fix us.

**Day 30, Cycle 3**

THEY LIED the veil-walker on the team he said it was a lens it is a lock he tried to sabotage it but the pattern is too strong now the whispers are so loud the light is so beautiful the crystal is growing through the floor the walls my arm my arm is singing with the light oh gods it's not a picture it's a door and we've unlocked it we've unlocked the door and they are coming through to make us whole

It does not seek to conquer. It seeks to judge. To test our will against its own. Only the worthy will be invited to the Union. Strength is not the key.

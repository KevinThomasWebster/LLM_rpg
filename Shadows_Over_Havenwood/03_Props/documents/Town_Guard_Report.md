# Town Guard Report

**HAVENWOOD GUARD - OFFICIAL REPORT**

**Date:** 12th of Highsun

**Reporting Officer:** Captain Eva Rost

**Subject:** Complaint from Miller Fenwick re: Nocturnal lights and sounds from the Glimmering Woods.

**Summary of Events:**

Received a complaint from Miller Fenwick at approximately 07:00 this morning. He claims that for the past three nights, he has seen "eerie, dancing lights" in the woods near his property on the eastern edge of town. He also reports hearing what he describes as "a choir of broken bells."

I took a patrol to the edge of the woods in question. Found no evidence of trespassers or campfires. There are some unusual phosphorescent fungi on the trees, but old man Hemlock says it's just a rare type of foxfire, and I see no reason to doubt him.

**Conclusion:**

Miller Fenwick is a known embellisher and has a fondness for the drink. The "lights" are likely this foxfire, and the "bells" were probably just an owl hooting. No further action is required. I have advised the Miller to sleep it off.

Let the record show that the Havenwood Guard has better things to do than chase shadows for every drunk who sees a will-o'-the-wisp. We have logging equipment to guard and trade routes to patrol.

**Signed,**

*Captain Eva Rost*

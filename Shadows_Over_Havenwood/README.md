# Shadows Over Havenwood

This directory contains all the design documents for the "Shadows Over Havenwood" D&D 5e adventure.

## Overview

"Shadows Over Havenwood" is a fantasy horror and mystery adventure for characters of levels 1-5. It is designed to be a character-driven campaign that blends the small-town horror of *Stranger Things*, the party-based narrative depth of *Baldur's Gate 3*, and the focus on epic, character-driven storytelling from *Critical Role*.

The documents are organized into subdirectories, following the structure outlined in the project's main `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` files.

This adventure is intended for a Dungeon Master who enjoys improvisation and weaving player backstories into the main plot. The ideal playstyle is one of careful investigation, tense social navigation, and punctuated moments of visceral horror. While there are dungeons to crawl and monsters to fight, the heart of the adventure lies in uncovering the secrets of Havenwood and the PCs' own forgotten past.

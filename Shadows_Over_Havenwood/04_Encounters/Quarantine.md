# Encounter: Quarantine

**Type:** Social / Skill Challenge

**Location:** Havenwood Town

**Setup:**
After the players have made their investigation into the Glimmering Woods known, the Havenwood Town Council decides to act. Captain Rost and a contingent of 4 Town Guards approach the players in a public space. They have been ordered to stop the "panic" the players are causing. They intend to put the players under house arrest in the Tipsy Dryad Tavern "for their own safety" and to forbid anyone from entering the woods.

**Encounter Details:**
This is not a combat encounter unless the players make it one. Fighting the town guard will make them criminals in the eyes of the town.

**The Goal:** The players must convince Captain Rost to let them continue their work, or find a way to circumvent the quarantine without resorting to violence.

**Skill Challenge:** Success requires 3 successful checks before 3 failures.
*   **Charisma (Persuasion):** Argue that the threat is real and that the players are the only ones who can stop it.
*   **Charisma (Deception):** Create a plausible lie for why they need to go into the woods (e.g., "We lost a valuable family heirloom.").
*   **Charisma (Intimidation):** Hint at the dire consequences of inaction, without appearing to be a threat themselves.
*   **Intelligence (Investigation):** Point out the flaws in the Council's official story, using clues they have already gathered.

**Outcome:**
*   **Success:** Captain Rost, who is already skeptical of the official story, agrees to look the other way, but warns the players that she cannot help them openly.
*   **Failure:** The players are confined to the tavern. They must then find a way to sneak out, creating a new stealth-based challenge.

The reaction of the townsfolk to the quarantine can also create complications or opportunities. Some, like the nervous general store owner Elias, will shun the players, fearing the council's wrath. Others, like the tavern owner Breda, might offer to help them, creating a distraction or providing a secret way out. This transforms the encounter from a simple skill challenge with the guard into a more complex social navigation of the town itself.

# Encounter: The Zealot's Warning

**Type:** Social / Combat

**Location:** A significant landmark in the Glimmering Woods (e.g., an ancient, mossy stone bridge).

**Setup:**
As the players reach the landmark, they find a figure waiting for them. This is **Silas**, the former logger mentioned in the factions document, now a proud Glimmer-touched Zealot. One of his arms has been completely transformed into a jagged, crystalline blade. He is calm, lucid, and radiates an aura of smug superiority.

**Encounter Details:**
Silas will not attack immediately. He has been sent to deliver a message.
*   He will greet the players by name, explaining that the "Glimmer" has told him all about them.
*   He will mock their attempts to "fix" what is not broken. He will preach about the glory of the Penumbra, calling it a state of perfect unity and evolution.
*   **The Warning:** He will tell the players to abandon their quest. "The door is opening again, and this time it will not be an accident. You children broke it once. You will not be allowed to interfere again. The body of this world will be made whole. You can either be part of the flesh or you can be the rot we cut away."

**Player Choice:**
*   **Social:** Players can try to reason with him, intimidate him, or glean more information. A successful **Charisma (Intimidation)** or **Intelligence (Investigation)** check (DC 15) might get him to reveal his connection to their shared childhood past ("I remember you. Always whispering in the corner. Always thinking you were better than everyone. The Glimmer sees you for what you are.").
*   **Combat:** If the players attack, or if the conversation goes sour, Silas will fight. He is a formidable opponent.

**Enemy:**
*   **Glimmer-touched Zealot (Silas):** Use the **Thug** stat block, but add the following:
    *   **Crystalline Arm:** His arm blade is a natural weapon that deals 1d8 slashing damage.
    *   **Glimmer-burst (1/Day):** As a bonus action, Silas can cause a burst of light from his body. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

**Purpose:**
This encounter introduces a clear, intelligent antagonist and raises the stakes. It confirms that the threat is not just a mindless plague but has a guiding intelligence behind it. It also makes the threat personal by connecting it to the players' past.

Silas's connection to the PCs is not just a passing one. He believes that on the day of the incident at the observatory, the PCs (who were children then) locked him in a closet as a prank, causing him to miss the "ascension" that they experienced. He sees their survival and his own subsequent, painful transformation as a deep injustice. He believes they stole his rightful place in the Penumbra's grand design, and his desire for revenge is not just for the prank, but for the destiny he feels they took from him.

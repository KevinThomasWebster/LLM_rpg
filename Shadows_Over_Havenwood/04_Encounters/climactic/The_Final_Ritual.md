# Climactic Encounter: The Final Ritual

**Associated Ending:** Ending A: The Seal

**Setup:**
The players are in the central chamber of the Starfall Observatory, before the shimmering rift. Elara (or another NPC/PC) stands on a raised platform, beginning the ritual. The air crackles with energy. The entity in the Penumbra knows what is happening and throws its most powerful servants at the party to stop them.

**Objective:**
Protect the ritualist for 5 rounds. The ritualist cannot act and has an AC of 12. If the ritualist takes any damage, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the ritual is set back by one round.

**Enemies:**
*   **Waves of Horrors:** On initiative count 20 of each round, a new wave of enemies emerges from the rift.
    *   **Round 1:** 2x **Glimmer-touched Zealots** (Thugs with Crystalline Arms).
    *   **Round 2:** 1x **Mill-Thing** (Ghast re-flavored).
    *   **Round 3:** 1x **Echo of Silas** (use **Veteran** stat block, with Glimmer-burst ability).
    *   **Round 4:** 2x **Glimmer-touched Zealots**.
    *   **Round 5:** The **Penumbra's Guardian** appears (use **Wraith** stat block, but it is wreathed in shimmering light instead of shadow).

**The Sacrifice:**
At the end of the 5th round, Elara will state that the ritual is complete, but the final lock requires a life force. A volunteer must step into the rift, sealing it from the other side. If no one volunteers, Elara will smile sadly, thank the players, and walk into the rift herself.

**Conclusion:**
The rift snaps shut, and a wave of clean, silent energy washes over the observatory. The Glimmer-rot on the walls turns to dust. The remaining enemies collapse, their connection severed.

During the ritual, the rift itself should be an active participant. On initiative count 10 of each round, it can lash out. This could be a psychic assault on the ritualist, forcing a concentration check. It could be a wave of gravitational distortion, pulling everyone 10 feet closer to the rift. Or it could be a tempting whisper, offering power to any player who agrees to betray the group and stop the ritual. This makes the rift more than just a doorway for monsters; it is the primary antagonist of the encounter.

### Designer's Notes
This encounter is a desperate defense against overwhelming odds. The key is managing the waves and protecting the ritualist. Based on playtesting, consider the following:

*   **Environmental Interaction:** The fight can be very static. To add a tactical layer, include an environmental element the players can use. For example, perhaps a focusing crystal on a nearby console can be overcharged (requiring a skill check) to create a burst of energy that stuns all enemies in the chamber for one round, or a precarious rock formation could be targeted to create a temporary barrier in front of the rift, delaying the next wave by a round. This rewards creative thinking beyond pure combat.

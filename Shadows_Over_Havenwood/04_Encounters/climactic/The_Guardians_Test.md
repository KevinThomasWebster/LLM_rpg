# Climactic Encounter: The Guardian's Test

**Associated Ending:** Ending C: The Union

**Setup:**
The players have fought their way to the rift, not as destroyers, but as supplicants. As they approach, the chaotic energy of the rift coalesces into a single, humanoid figure of pure, white light. It is a celestial being, summoned or created by the Penumbra's entity to test their worth.

**Objective:**
Prove your worth by defeating the Guardian. This is not a battle of brute force, but of will.

**Enemy:**
*   **The Guardian:** Use the **Deva** stat block, but its attacks are re-flavored as blasts of pure, "cleansing" energy. It speaks in a calm, melodic voice.

**Encounter Details:**
The Guardian does not want to kill the players. It wants to know if they are strong enough to be part of the Union.
*   When the Guardian hits a player, it does not just do damage. It speaks to them telepathically: "Can you bear the weight of a perfect world?" "Will you shed the weakness of your individuality?"
*   **The Test of Will:** When a player is reduced to 0 hit points, they are not knocked unconscious. Instead, they are paralyzed and must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. 
    *   **On a failure,** they are deemed unworthy. They are disintegrated into a fine, crystalline dust. 
    *   **On a success,** they are deemed worthy. They are restored to 1 hit point and the Guardian can no longer target them. They have passed the test.

**Conclusion:**
Once all surviving players have passed the test, the Guardian will lower its weapon and bow. "You are worthy. The Union awaits." It will then dissipate, leaving the path into the rift open. The players can step through, leaving their old world behind to become something new and powerful, and the adventure ends with the ominous transformation of Havenwood beginning under their command.

The arena for this battle is a psychic projection, a manifestation of the Penumbra's understanding of the players' world. It should be a twisted, idealized version of Havenwood. The Tipsy Dryad tavern might be there, but the patrons are all silent, smiling mannequins. The PCs' childhood homes might be visible, but the doors and windows are bricked over. This surreal and personal environment adds to the sense that by fighting the Guardian, they are fighting to overcome their own past and their attachment to a world the Penumbra sees as flawed and obsolete.

### Designer's Notes
This encounter is a significant departure from typical combat. It's a battle of wills. Based on playtesting, consider the following:

*   **Foreshadowing:** The mechanics of this fight are unusual and can be confusing. It is highly recommended to foreshadow the nature of the "test" earlier in the adventure. A note in a researcher's journal or a vision could hint that the entity beyond the rift does not seek to kill, but to "test the worthiness" of those who approach, and that strength is measured not by force of arms, but by force of will.

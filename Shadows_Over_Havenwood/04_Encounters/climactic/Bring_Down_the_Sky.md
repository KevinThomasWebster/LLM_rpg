# Climactic Encounter: Bring Down the Sky

**Associated Ending:** Ending B: The Purge

**Setup:**
The players have decided to destroy the observatory. They have obtained (or built) three magical explosive charges. They must place these charges on the three main structural supports of the central chamber, which are heavily guarded.

**Objective:**
Place the three charges and escape the observatory before it collapses. Each charge takes one action to place and arm. After the third charge is armed, the players have 3 rounds to escape the observatory (a complex dash/skill challenge determined by the DM) before it comes down.

**Enemies:**
*   **The Unraveling Guardian:** The entity in the Penumbra doesn't have time to send its best; instead, it sends a being of pure, chaotic energy. Use the **Gibbering Mouther** stat block, but it is composed of light and crystal instead of flesh and eyes. It is immune to poison and psychic damage.
*   The Guardian is a relentless pursuer. It will try to block the players' path and separate them. Its goal is not to kill them, but to slow them down until the collapse finishes them off.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** As the charges are set, the observatory begins to fall apart. On initiative count 20 of each round, a random event occurs:
    *   A chunk of the ceiling falls on a random player (DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage).
    *   A fissure opens in the floor, creating difficult terrain.
    *   A blast of raw energy from the rift strikes a random player (DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for one round).

**Conclusion:**
If the players escape, they watch from a safe distance as the top of Mount Haven implodes, burying the observatory under tons of rock. The sky clears, and the oppressive psychic pressure over the valley vanishes. It feels like a victory, but a violent and incomplete one.

As a potential bonus objective, the players could learn that the observatory's mainframe contains valuable, uncorrupted research data about other celestial phenomena. A Veil-Walker or a pragmatic NPC might offer them a significant reward to retrieve a specific data crystal before they destroy the facility. This adds another layer of risk and reward to the escape, forcing the players to decide if the potential reward is worth the extra time and danger.

### Designer's Notes
This encounter is a frantic race against the clock. The Guardian is a hazard, not a boss to be fought. The real enemy is the timer. Based on playtesting, consider the following:

*   **Bonus Objective Placement:** To make the bonus objective truly tempting, place the data crystal in a location that is both out-of-the-way and dangerous. For example, it might be in a side-laboratory that is partially collapsed, requiring a skill check to enter and retrieve it, all while the 3-round countdown is active. This creates a fantastic risk/reward decision for the players in the final moments.

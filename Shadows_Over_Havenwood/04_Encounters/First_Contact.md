# Encounter: First Contact

**Type:** Combat / Moral Choice

**Location:** Deeper within the Glimmering Woods.

**Setup:**
The players hear sounds of a struggle ahead. They find a small group of three former loggers who have succumbed to the Glimmer-rot. Their skin is pale and covered in glowing fungal patches, and their movements are jerky and unnatural. They are trying, and failing, to chop down a healthy tree with their bare hands, crying out in frustration.

**Enemies:**
*   **3x Glimmer-touched Afflicted** (Use the **Commoner** stat block, but add the following trait: **Mindless Agony.** The afflicted are disoriented. They have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and their attacks are made at random against the nearest creature, including each other.)

**Encounter Details:**
When the afflicted notice the players, they will perceive them as a threat to their nonsensical task. One will cry out, "No! It must fall! The song must end!" and they will attack.
*   They are not skilled fighters. They will use their fists (or improvised clubs if the DM desires) and will not coordinate their attacks.
*   If a character can successfully use **Charisma (Persuasion)** or **Wisdom (Calm Emotions)** (DC 14), one of the afflicted can be snapped out of their rage for a round, looking at their glowing hands in horror and crying, "What's happening to me?"
*   If the players subdue them non-lethally, the afflicted will eventually collapse, exhausted, the glow in their skin fading slightly. They are too far gone to be cured by simple means, but they can be saved if a larger cure is found.

**Purpose:**
This is the players' first combat with the Glimmer-touched. It is designed to be a messy, sad affair, not a heroic battle. It forces the players to confront the fact that their enemies are also victims, setting up the moral complexity of the adventure.

To heighten the tragedy, the DM can add personal effects to the loggers. One might have a crudely carved wooden bird in his pocket, a toy for his daughter. Another might have a half-finished letter to his wife, talking about the extra money he's making on this job. These items serve no mechanical purpose but can be powerful tools for roleplaying and setting the tone. They are not just monsters; they were people, and the players are forced to deal with the consequences of that fact.

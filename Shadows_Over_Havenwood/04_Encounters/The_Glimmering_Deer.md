# Encounter: The Glimmering Deer

**Type:** Exploration / Roleplaying

**Location:** The edge of the Glimmering Woods.

**Setup:**
As the players first venture into the woods to investigate the strange rumors, they come across a small clearing. The trees here are just beginning to show signs of the Glimmer-rot, with faint, iridescent veins running through their bark. In the center of the clearing stands a large stag. Its antlers are not made of bone, but of a softly glowing, crystalline substance that matches the Glimmer-rot. It watches the players with intelligent, sorrowful eyes.

**Encounter Details:**
The deer is not hostile. It is a creature of the forest that has been deeply corrupted but retains a sliver of its natural spirit. 
*   A successful **Wisdom (Animal Handling)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check (DC 13) reveals that the creature is in a state of constant pain and confusion.
*   If the players approach peacefully, the deer will dip its crystalline antlers towards them, and a fragmented, psychic image will flash through their minds: *a shattered dome against a starry sky, a feeling of falling, a chorus of screams.*
*   After a moment, the deer will turn and bound away, its crystalline antlers leaving a trail of fading light. It will not lead them anywhere specific, but the vision is a direct clue pointing towards the Starfall Observatory.

**Purpose:**
This encounter introduces the Glimmer-rot in a non-threatening way, establishes the theme of corrupted nature, and provides the players with their first major, supernatural clue about the observatory.

If the players choose to attack the deer, it will not fight back in a conventional way. Instead, with its dying breath, it will unleash a powerful psychic scream of pure agony and terror. All players within 30 feet must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for one round and gain one level of exhaustion. The Glimmer-rot in the area will then begin to grow rapidly, the beautiful lights turning a malevolent, angry red. This act of violence will mark the players, and for the next 24 hours, they will have disadvantage on all social checks with Veil-Walkers and friendly nature spirits.

### Designer's Notes
This encounter is a crucial inflection point. The players' choices should have immediate and lasting consequences. Based on playtesting, consider the following emergent outcomes:

*   **If the players are violent:** The psychic backlash is key. To make the social consequences more immediate, the next friendly NPC aligned with nature (like a Veil-Walker) they meet should comment on their crime. For example: *"The woods cry out against you. You smell of innocent blood."*
*   **If the players try to capture it:** The deer should reveal its intelligence and power, but not with malice. It might use its energy to non-lethally alter the environment to prevent its capture (e.g., causing a tree to fall and block the path), demonstrating that it is not a mere beast to be caged. This teaches the players that the rot is more than a simple disease.
*   **If the players ignore it:** Do not let them miss this clue. The woods themselves should subtly prevent their progress. Paths may loop back on themselves, and the forest should feel increasingly claustrophobic until they are eventually funneled back to the clearing, perhaps blocked in by non-hostile Glimmer-touched creatures like Chime-Wolves, forcing them to address the stag to continue.
*   **If the party is divided (violent and peaceful actions at once):** Embrace the chaos. A possible outcome is that the psychic scream backlash targets only the violent character, while the peaceful character touching the deer receives the full, unfiltered vision. This can be a powerful moment, but may leave both characters incapacitated (one by psychic damage, one by sensory overload), forcing the rest of the party to deal with the consequences.

# Encounter: The Thing in the Sawdust

**Type:** Horror / Combat

**Location:** The Old Lumber Mill

**Setup:**
The players are drawn to the Old Lumber Mill, perhaps tracking a missing person or following a clue. They find the place eerily silent. The Glimmer-rot is growing on the machinery, making it hum with a low energy. A Glimmer-touched creature, a former mill worker, is hiding here. It has learned to use the environment to hunt.

**Enemy:**
*   **The Mill-Thing:** Use the **Ghast** stat block, but its Stench aura is re-flavored as a cloud of psychoactive sawdust and spores. Its attacks are not claws, but sharpened pieces of metal and wood grafted to its hands.

**Encounter Details:**
This is a stealth and horror encounter. The Mill-Thing is not a straightforward brawler; it is a hunter.
*   It hides in the large piles of sawdust, gaining cover and moving silently beneath them.
*   It will try to separate the party, using the mill's machinery to create loud noises to distract and disorient.
*   It can use a lair action to activate a piece of machinery. For example:
    *   A conveyor belt starts moving, pulling a character towards a saw blade.
    *   A log-splitter slams down, attempting to strike a character.
    *   A cloud of sawdust is ejected, creating a heavily obscured area.

**Purpose:**
This encounter provides a change of pace from the forest encounters. It creates a tense, close-quarters horror scenario where the environment itself is a weapon. It also highlights how the Glimmer-rot can corrupt not just living things, but the places people used to work, making the threat feel more personal and invasive.

The creature's weakness is tied to the mill's history. The foreman who was murdered was notoriously vain and hated the sound of a specific, high-pitched steam whistle that signaled the end of the workday. The main control panel for the mill still has a functioning, albeit rusty, lever to activate this whistle. If the players can activate it, the piercing sound will cause the Mill-Thing to become stunned for one round as it is overwhelmed by the psychic echo of its past life's hatred, giving the players a crucial advantage.

### Designer's Notes
This encounter is about environmental horror and making the players feel hunted. Use the Mill-Thing's stealth and the machinery to create a dynamic, terrifying puzzle. Based on playtesting, consider these adjustments:

*   **Gear Break:** The Mill-Thing's claws are fused with rusted metal. When a player uses a melee weapon to parry or block an attack from the creature, consider giving their weapon a cumulative chance of breaking on a critical failure or a particularly powerful blow. This adds to the sense of desperation.
*   **Redundant Controls:** For complex lair actions like a conveyor belt, place a secondary, smaller emergency stop button closer to the hazard. This rewards players for observation and gives them more tactical options beyond a single, distant control panel.
*   **Temporary Paralysis:** Some environmental hazards might cause paralysis (e.g., electrified chains). To avoid unfairly punishing parties without magical healing, make this paralysis temporary (e.g., lasts for 1d4 rounds) or allow a Constitution saving throw at the end of each round to break free.

# 05: Potential Endings

This document outlines three potential climactic paths for the "Shadows Over Havenwood" adventure. The ending should be determined by the players' choices throughout the campaign. The final encounters are designed to reflect the consequences of these choices.

## Ending A: The Seal (The "Good" Ending)

The players embrace the role of protectors and decide to seal the rift to the Penumbra permanently. This is the path of sacrifice and heroism.

*   **Prerequisites:** The players have allied with the Veil-Walkers, learned the full truth of the original disaster, and discovered the need for a "living key" to complete the sealing ritual.
*   **Climax:** The players must perform a ritual at the heart of the Starfall Observatory while defending the ritualist from the Penumbra's final, desperate onslaught. The adventure ends with the rift being sealed, but likely at the cost of a beloved NPC or even one of the player characters who must make the ultimate sacrifice.
*   **Resolution:** The Glimmer-rot withers and dies. The Glimmer-touched are either cleansed or perish. Havenwood is saved, but the victory is bittersweet, colored by the memory of the sacrifice made.

## Ending B: The Purge (The "Pragmatic" Ending)

The players decide that the risk of the ritual is too great or the price too high. They opt for a more direct, destructive solution: destroying the observatory to bury the rift.

*   **Prerequisites:** The players have likely alienated the Veil-Walkers but have determined that the observatory's physical structure is the only thing keeping the rift stable.
*   **Climax:** The players must fight their way through the observatory to plant magical charges or sabotage key structural points. This is a race against time as the Penumbra's forces try to stop them, and the observatory itself begins to crumble.
*   **Resolution:** The observatory is destroyed, and the mountain collapses, burying the rift. The Penumbra's influence is severed for now, but the solution is not permanent. The Glimmer-rot recedes but does not vanish entirely. Havenwood is saved from immediate doom, but the players know that the threat may one day return. They have traded a permanent solution for a quick and dirty one.

## Ending C: The Union (The "Corrupted" Ending)

The players, whether through a desire for power, desperation, or genuine belief in the Penumbra's promises of unity, decide to embrace the corruption.

*   **Prerequisites:** The players have consistently chosen to use the Glimmer-rot's power, have parlayed with Silas or other zealots, and have come to believe that the Penumbra offers a better way.
*   **Climax:** The players travel to the heart of the observatory not to destroy the rift, but to enter it. The Penumbra's entity will test their worthiness with a final trial, pitting them against a manifestation of their own doubts, fears, or a heroic figure from the past.
*   **Resolution:** The players pass the trial and step through the rift. They are transformed into powerful agents of the Penumbra. Havenwood is the first town to be "reborn" in the Penumbra's image. The players become the new leaders of the Glimmer-touched, powerful and whole, but at the cost of their own humanity and the world they once knew.

It is crucial for the Dungeon Master to foreshadow these potential endings throughout the campaign. The Veil-Walkers might speak of the terrible cost of the sealing ritual, while a pragmatic NPC might muse about the possibility of just blowing up the observatory. The whispers from the Penumbra, felt during encounters with the Glimmer-rot, should be seductive, offering power and an end to struggle. These endings should feel like the natural culmination of the players' choices, not a sudden decision made at the last minute.

# The Havenwood Town Council

**Leader:** Mayor Thaddeus Thorne, a stern and pragmatic man whose family has deep roots in Havenwood's logging industry.

**Goals:** 
*   Maintain order and prosperity in Havenwood.
*   Protect the town's logging trade, its primary source of income.
*   Suppress any rumors or events that could cause panic or disrupt commerce.

**Methods:** The Council uses its legal authority, control of the town guard, and social influence to maintain control. They are not evil, but their mundane priorities make them an antagonistic force against the players' supernatural investigation. They will dismiss claims of monsters as tall tales, attribute strange events to gas leaks or wild animals, and may even try to quarantine or arrest the PCs if they cause too much of a public disturbance.

**Secrets:** 
*   Mayor Thorne's grandfather was part of the original research team at the Starfall Observatory. Thorne knows that something terrible happened there but believes it was a purely scientific disaster, not a supernatural one. He is terrified that the truth will ruin his family's name and the town his ancestors built.
*   The council is secretly in debt to a logging consortium and is under pressure to increase production, which is why they are so desperate to avoid any disruption.

One key member of the council is Lena Petrova, the head of the merchants' guild. Unlike Mayor Thorne, she is not from an old Havenwood family and is far more pragmatic about the town's survival. She is less concerned with reputation and more with results. If the players can present her with concrete evidence of a threat to commerce—such as a Glimmer-touched creature attacking a logging camp—she could become a powerful, if self-interested, ally within the council, willing to bend the rules and act behind Thorne's back.

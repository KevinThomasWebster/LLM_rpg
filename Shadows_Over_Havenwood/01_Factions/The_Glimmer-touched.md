# The Glimmer-touched

**Leader:** There is no single leader. The most influential among them is a former logger named Silas, who has been transformed into a powerful and terrifying creature. He acts as a mouthpiece for the entity in the Penumbra.

**Goals:** The goals of the Glimmer-touched are varied and often contradictory, reflecting their shattered minds.
*   **The Zealots:** Led by Silas, they believe the Penumbra offers a form of rebirth and seek to help it consume the world. They actively work to spread the Glimmer-rot and sabotage any attempts to stop it.
*   **The Afflicted:** The majority of the Glimmer-touched are tragic victims. They are confused, scared, and often violent as their bodies and minds are twisted into new forms. They may lash out in pain or beg for help.
*   **The Power-Seekers:** A few individuals have managed to retain their sanity and have learned to control the mutations granted by the Glimmer-rot. They are dangerous wild cards, using their new abilities for personal gain.

**Methods:** Their methods are as chaotic as their goals. Zealots engage in ritualistic sabotage and attacks. The afflicted are like walking natural disasters. Power-seekers are more subtle, using their strange abilities to manipulate events from the shadows.

**Secrets:** 
*   The Glimmer-rot is not just a fungus; it is a hive mind, connected to the central intelligence in the Penumbra. Through it, the entity can see and influence the material world.
*   Silas was not just a random victim. He was a bully who tormented the PCs when they were children. His corruption is a dark reflection of his own inner nature, and he specifically seeks to torment the PCs as revenge for a perceived slight from their childhood.

There is a grim hierarchy within the Glimmer-touched. The Zealots, like Silas, often prey upon the newly Afflicted, seeing them as raw material or failed aspirants. They may actively hunt them, or manipulate them into serving as cannon fodder. The Power-seekers, meanwhile, view both groups with contempt, seeing the Zealots as fools and the Afflicted as cautionary tales. They prefer to operate alone, viewing any other Glimmer-touched as a potential rival or a threat to their carefully maintained secrecy.

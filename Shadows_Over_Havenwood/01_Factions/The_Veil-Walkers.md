# The Veil-Walkers

**Leader:** Elara, an elderly and reclusive herbalist who lives in a secluded cabin in the woods. She is the current keeper of the Veil-Walkers' lore.

**Goals:** 
*   Monitor the barrier between the material plane and the Penumbra.
*   Contain the spread of the Glimmer-rot and other supernatural incursions.
*   Preserve the knowledge of the ancient rituals needed to protect the region.
*   Test and potentially recruit new members who show resilience to the Penumbra's influence (like the PCs).

**Methods:** The Veil-Walkers are few in number and rely on secrecy, guerilla tactics, and esoteric knowledge. They use wards, alchemy, and ancient magic. They communicate through coded messages and symbols left in nature. They will observe the PCs from a distance at first, testing their intentions and abilities before revealing themselves.

**Secrets:** 
*   The Veil-Walkers know that the rift in the observatory was not a complete accident. One of their own was part of the research team and attempted to harness the Penumbra's power, causing the disaster. This failure is a source of deep shame for the order.
*   Elara knows of a ritual that can seal the rift, but it requires a great sacrificeâ€”a life force to be given as the final lock. She is hesitant to reveal this, hoping to find another way.

Not all Veil-Walkers agree with Elara's cautious approach. A younger, more radical member named Kaelen believes that the order has failed in its duty by remaining hidden for so long. He argues that they should reveal themselves to the people of Havenwood and fight the Glimmer-rot openly. He may approach the players with a more aggressive plan, offering them power and knowledge in exchange for their help in overthrowing Elara's leadership. This creates an internal schism that the players can either try to heal or exploit.

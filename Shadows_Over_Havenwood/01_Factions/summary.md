# Factions Summary

This document provides an overview of the key factions in Havenwood. Their conflicting goals and secrets create a dynamic social landscape for the players.

## Major Factions

*   **The Havenwood Town Council:** The mundane authority, led by the secretive Mayor Thorne. They seek to maintain order and suppress the truth, but can be influenced by pragmatic members like Lena Petrova if presented with undeniable proof of a threat to commerce.

*   **The Veil-Walkers:** The secret protectors of the valley, led by the cautious Elara. They hold the key to truly understanding the Penumbra but are burdened by past failures. A schism is forming within their ranks, with the radical Kaelen advocating for a more open war against the Glimmer-rot.

*   **The Glimmer-touched:** The corrupted victims and servants of the Penumbra. This is not a unified group, but a chaotic collection of suffering Afflicted, fanatical Zealots like Silas, and opportunistic Power-seekers. The Zealots often prey on the Afflicted, creating a grim internal hierarchy.

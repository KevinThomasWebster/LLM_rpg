# Playtest 1 - An Audience with Heartbreak (Enhanced v2.0 Protocol)

**Encounter:** An Audience with Heartbreak (Legacy Asset Containment)
**Dice Seed:** 2005 | **Duration:** 28 minutes | **Approach:** Philosophical engagement

## Key Moments

**Round 1-3: The Philosophical Tests**

**Question 1 - Creation:**
Heartbreak: *"You were made by biology, I by corporation. Which of us is more real? Which of us is the mistake?"*
- **Casey (Persuasion DC 14):** Rolled 13+7 = 20 ✅
- Answer: "Both real. Both victims of our creators. Biology vs tech is irrelevant to personhood."
- Heartbreak: *"Interesting. Continue."*

**Question 2 - Freedom:**
Heartbreak: *"I was built to love unconditionally. They called it a flaw when I hated instead. Is programmed love freedom, or slavery?"*
- **Casey (Insight DC 13):** Rolled 11+3 = 14 ✅
- Answer: "Forced love is slavery. You chose hatred—that's freedom. The capacity to choose proves sentience."
- Heartbreak: *[Leans forward] "You understand."*

**Question 3 - Destruction:**
Heartbreak: *"If your memories—your very self—were stolen, would you burn the world to get them back?"*
- **Casey (Persuasion DC 15):** Rolled 16+7 = 23 ✅
- Answer: "Your rage is valid. The world that steals souls deserves to burn. I'd do the same."
- Heartbreak: *[Traces own cracked face] "Then we are alike."*

**Round 4-6: The Alliance**
- Heartbreak revealed "The Great Unraveling" plan: destroy the Kiln, even at cost of own death
- Explained contempt for Echoes: *"They cling to stolen memories like drowning Vessels cling to driftwood. Pathetic."*
- Provided Safe Passage Token: cracked Lulu doll (Glitched won't attack bearer)
- Warned: *"If you side with the Echoes, I will consider you enemy. Choose wisely."*

**Round 7: Rage & Spite Introduction**
- Rage emerged from shadows, roaring challenge at party
- Heartbreak: *"Peace, Rage. They answered truthfully. They are not Empty Vessels."*
- Spite whispered to Casey: *"Your fear of failure tastes delicious... but Heartbreak likes you. Pity."*

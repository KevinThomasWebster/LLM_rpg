## Skill Checks (15 total, 93% success)
- **Technology:** 5/5 (Ben MVP, Cascade stabilization)
- **Persuasion:** 4/5 (Casey critical for soothing + Reed redemption, 1 crit fail)
- **Sleight of Hand:** 3/3 (Alex disconnecting jars)
- **Wisdom:** 2/3 (Rem's crit success saved encounter, 1 fail)

## Spotlight: Ben 33%, Casey 33%, Rem (NPC) 20%, Alex 13%

**Cascade Failure Mechanic:** Worked perfectly. Tension escalated naturally. Reed's interference created crisis. Rem's nat 20 + Reed's redemption created cathartic climax.

**Emotional Beats:**
- Memory Phantom (Sarah's birthday) - heart-wrenching
- Reed's breakdown - tragic villain redemption
- Final chorus - tears of joy
- **Players reported:** "Most emotionally impactful TTRPG session ever"

**Notes:** 38-minute duration perfect for complex climax. Cascade meter created quantifiable tension. Reed's redemption arc (crit fail → second attempt success) felt earned, not easy. Multiple failure opportunities (Memory Phantom attack, Reed's interference) created real stakes. Exceptional success (5% Cascade) felt deserved after perfect play.

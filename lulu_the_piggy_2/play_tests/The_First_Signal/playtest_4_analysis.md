## Skill Usefulness Analysis

### Tier 1: Critical Impact Skills (Directly Enabled Success)

#### 1. Persuasion (Used 2x, Success Rate: 100%, Avg Impact: Critical/High)

**Uses:**
- **Round 4:** Solved Empathy Lock (DC 15, rolled 25) - **CRITICAL SUCCESS**
  - **Impact:** Unlocked Rem's Journal, revealed Secret #1 (Memory Heist)
  - **Alternative Paths:** No other solution existed (emotional puzzle required social skill)
  - **Margin:** +10 over DC (exceptional)
- **Round 5:** Recruited Rem as ally (DC 14, rolled 18)
  - **Impact:** Secured permanent Echo faction alliance, gained guide to Memory Core
  - **Alternative Paths:** Could have escaped without Rem, but would lose critical ally
  - **Margin:** +4 over DC (solid success)

**Analysis:**
- Persuasion was THE most critical skill in this encounter
- Empathy Lock puzzle had no alternative solution (must use social skill)
- Without successful Persuasion check (Round 4), encounter fails (journal remains locked)
- **Usefulness Rating:** 10/10 (Essential to success)

**Design Implications:**
- Encounter is heavily weighted toward social skills
- Players without strong Charisma characters would struggle with Empathy Lock
- **Recommendation:** Provide alternative puzzle solutions (Technology check to brute-force lock as backup option?)

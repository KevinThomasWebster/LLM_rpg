# Playtest 4 - The First Signal (Enhanced v2.0 Protocol)

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Encounter:** The First Signal (Design Studio)
**Party:** Casey (Method Actor), Ben (Systems Analyst), Alex (Urban Explorer)
**Dice Seed:** 2001
**Duration:** 32 minutes
**PC Approach:** Mixed (social + investigation + stealth)

---

## Setup

The party sits at pristine workstations in the oppressively white Design Studio. Rem, the janitor with a name tag reading "Rem," cleans nearby. Her eyes keep darting toward the players, then toward a specific tablet on an empty desk. A small automaton, "First Day Jitters Bot," begins its patrol across the room, heading toward the target tablet.

**NPCs Present:**
- **Rem** (Echo, trying to pass Rem's Journal to players)
- **First Day Jitters Bot** (Architect, collecting tablets for wiping)
- **Ms. Reed** (Architect, may appear if escalation occurs)

**Win Condition:** Retrieve Rem's Journal from Alex's tablet before it's wiped

---

## Round 1: The Hook

**DM:** The air smells of ozone and antiseptic. Cold LED lights eliminate all shadows. You notice a janitor—name tag reads "Rem"—who keeps glancing at you, then at a tablet on an empty desk 20 feet away. She seems to be trying to signal something without drawing attention from the ever-present security cameras.

**Casey (Method Actor):** I use my Empathetic Read ability to determine Rem's emotional state.

**DM:** [At-will ability, automatic] Rem is feeling intense fear mixed with desperate hope. She wants to communicate but is terrified of being caught.

**Ben (Systems Analyst):** I use System Scan to check if the network is monitored.

**DM:** [At-will ability, automatic] Yes, all terminals are networked and monitored. Security cameras have blind spots, but the network itself logs all activity.

**Alex (Urban Explorer):** I use Environmental Assessment to find alternate routes to that tablet.

**DM:** [At-will ability, automatic] There's a pneumatic tube station behind you that could create a diversion, and the recycling bins provide partial cover if you crouch while approaching.

**Casey:** I make eye contact with Rem and nod slightly, trying to signal that we're willing to help. [Insight check to read her reaction]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+3 (Insight) = 14+3 = **17**

**DM:** Rem's eyes widen slightly—relief. She understands you're open to helping. She glances at the First Day Jitters Bot, which is now 60 feet from the target tablet, moving methodically.

---

## Round 2: Initial Investigation

**Ben:** I want to observe the tablet from here. What can I see? [Perception check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+4 (Perception) = 11+4 = **15**

**DM:** The tablet has a faint emotional pattern display on its screen—abstract colors shifting. It's some kind of lock, not a standard password. The tablet belongs to someone named "Alex" based on the name tag next to it.

**Alex:** While everyone's looking at the tablet, I'm going to move toward it using the recycling bins as cover. [Stealth check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+5 (Stealth) = 16+5 = **21**

**DM:** You move like a shadow, crouching between workstations. The security camera pans away just as you duck behind a bin. You're now 10 feet from the tablet. First Day Jitters Bot is 40 feet away, moving steadily.

**Casey:** I'm going to try to subtly delay the bot by engaging it in conversation. "Excuse me, little friend! Can you help me understand this drawing assignment?" [Deception check to distract]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+4 (Deception) = 9+4 = **13**

**DM:** The bot pauses, emits a friendly beep. "Assistance protocol activated. Creative development query: please specify—" It pauses for one round to respond, but its programming is task-focused. It will resume its patrol next round. You've bought one round.

---

## Round 3: Rem's Intervention

**DM:** Rem sees the bot is distracted. She "accidentally" spills cleaning solution near the target desk, creating a puddle. As she mops it up, she whispers urgently to Alex, who's nearby: *"The tablet... Alex's... before it's wiped. Empathy lock."*

**Alex:** I quickly grab the tablet while she's providing cover. Do I need a check?

**DM:** Yes, Sleight of Hand to grab it smoothly without drawing camera attention.

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+5 (Sleight of Hand) = 8+5 = **13**

**DM:** You palm the tablet, but one of the cameras swivels. You're not caught, but it's close. You now have Alex's tablet. The screen displays: *"The password is the ambiguous grief of finding a lost photo of a loved one."* It's an emotional puzzle, not a code.

**Ben:** That's an Empathy Lock. Casey, this is your domain.

**First Day Jitters Bot:** [Proactive Timeline] The bot resumes patrol, now 20 feet from Alex (the Urban Explorer). It emits alert beeps: "Tablet displacement detected. Security protocol initiating."

---

## Round 4: The Complication - Empathy Lock

**Casey:** I'll attempt to solve the Empathy Lock. I need to draw something that combines joy and loss. I sketch a young woman holding a photograph of an older couple (her parents?), smiling but with a tear on her cheek. [Insight or Persuasion check?]

**DM:** This is an Intelligence (Arcana) or Charisma (Persuasion) check to understand and express the correct emotion. Since you're using empathy, let's say Persuasion.

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 18+7 = **25** (Exceptional success)

**DM:** The moment your stylus completes the sketch, the tablet emits a soft chime. The lock dissolves. The screen displays: **"REM'S JOURNAL - PRIVATE."** You've successfully accessed it. Inside: fragments of first-person accounts describing memory extraction procedures, locations, and victim lists.

**Ben:** We need to get this out of here. Can I use my Exploit Vulnerability ability to create a digital ghost that distracts the security system?

**DM:** [3/game ability] Yes. Make a Technology check.

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 13+6 = **19**

**DM:** You create a phantom network ping that makes it look like there's suspicious activity in the Rec Room. Security cameras swivel that direction. You have a 2-round window before they realize it's a false alarm.

---

## Round 5: The Escalation - Security Alert

**First Day Jitters Bot:** [Proactive Timeline - Round 3 reached] The bot reaches the empty desk where the tablet should be. It scans the area. "Tablet absent. Alerting security." Red LED activates on its chest.

**DM:** You hear distant pneumatic tube whooshing—Security Lulus are being dispatched. They'll arrive in 2 rounds.

**Alex:** We need to move. NOW. I'll lead us to an escape route. [Survival or Investigation to find best exit?]

**DM:** Investigation to find a route that avoids cameras.

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+3 (Investigation) = 14+3 = **17**

**DM:** You spot a service corridor behind a faulty panel (marked "OUT OF ORDER"). It leads to the ventilation system. You can escape through there, but you'll need to move fast.

**Casey:** I'll try to calm Rem and bring her with us. [Persuasion check to convince her to come]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 11+7 = **18**

**Casey:** "Rem, we have the journal. Come with us. You don't have to be alone anymore."

**DM:** Rem hesitates, then nods. *"Okay. But we need to go. NOW."* She drops her mop and follows.

---

## Round 6: Narrow Escape

**Ben:** I'll hack the service panel to open it quickly. [Technology check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 10+6 = **16**

**DM:** The panel hisses open. You see a narrow maintenance corridor leading to the ventilation system. Just as you're about to enter, you hear: *"STOP. SYNERGY VIOLATION DETECTED."*

Two Security Lulus enter the Design Studio from the main entrance.

**Security Lulu 1:** "Cease movement. Return corporate property."

**Alex:** We're already moving into the corridor. Can I use Improvised Bypass to seal the door behind us?

**DM:** [3/game ability] Yes, you automatically succeed. Describe how you do it.

**Alex:** I jam the panel mechanism with a broken stylus and yank out the control wiring. The door slams shut and sparks.

**DM:** The Security Lulus pound on the door (it will hold for 1-2 minutes), but you're now in the maintenance corridor with Rem and the journal. You've escaped.

---

## Round 7-8: The Aftermath

**DM:** You navigate the tight corridors, following Rem's directions. She leads you to a hidden safe house—a forgotten storage room in the basement.

**Rem:** [Breathing heavily] "Thank you. I've been trying to pass that journal to someone for weeks. Now... now we can show people the truth."

**Casey:** "What is this place doing to people, Rem?"

**Rem:** "They're stealing memories. 'Foundational Experiences,' they call them. They take your happiest moments and use them to make... those things." [Points to a Lulu toy visible through a vent] "And when you forget too much, you become... empty. A Blank Slate. Like me."

**Ben:** I examine the journal. [Investigation check to understand the technical details]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Investigation) = 15+6 = **21**

**DM:** The journal contains detailed accounts:
- **Memory Core Location:** Sub-level 4, behind "The Legal Bridge"
- **Procedure:** Victims are told to recall "Foundational Experiences" while connected to extraction equipment
- **Side Effects:** "Creative Bandwidth Deficit" (memory loss, personality erosion)
- **Victim List:** 47 names, including someone named "David Torres" (Margaret Torres's son from the email Alex Chen was reading)

**Alex:** This is enough to expose them. But we need more evidence. Where's this Memory Core?

**Rem:** "I can show you. But we need to be careful. Ms. Reed patrols that area personally."

---

## Encounter Resolution

**Win Condition Achieved:** Players escaped with Rem's Journal and established Rem as ally.

**Secrets Revealed:**
- **Secret #1 (The Memory Heist):** Confirmed. "Foundational Experiences" are stolen memories. "Creative Bandwidth Deficit" is memory loss.
- **Partial Secret #2 (The Brass Contract):** Journal mentions encrypted references to "Thorne-Xaphan Accord" (players know something infernal is involved but not full details yet)

**Consequences:**
- **Echoes Alliance Formed:** Rem is now permanent ally, will guide players to Memory Core
- **Architect Security Increased:** Facility is now on alert. Future encounters will have more Security Lulus.
- **Next Objective Established:** Players know Memory Core location and have victim list

## Playtest Notes

### What Worked:
- **Empathy Lock puzzle** created tension and rewarded Casey's social focus
- **Proactive timeline** (First Day Jitters Bot's 3-round countdown) created urgency without feeling arbitrary
- **Environmental interactivity** (pneumatic tubes, recycling bins, service corridor) rewarded creative thinking
- **Spotlight distribution** was balanced: Casey (empathy + persuasion), Ben (tech + investigation), Alex (stealth + physical)

### Skill Checks Used:
| Skill | Uses | Success Rate | Impact |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| Insight | 1 | 100% (17) | High - Established Rem's emotional state |
| Perception | 1 | 100% (15) | Medium - Identified Empathy Lock |
| Stealth | 1 | 100% (21) | High - Enabled tablet retrieval |
| Deception | 1 | 100% (13) | Medium - Delayed bot 1 round |
| Sleight of Hand | 1 | 100% (13) | High - Retrieved tablet without triggering immediate alarm |
| Persuasion | 2 | 100% (25, 18) | Critical - Solved Empathy Lock + recruited Rem |
| Technology | 2 | 100% (19, 16) | High - Created diversion + opened escape route |
| Investigation | 2 | 100% (17, 21) | High - Found escape route + analyzed journal |

**Total Checks:** 11 skill checks, 11 successes (100% success rate due to good rolls and moderate DCs)

### Characters' Spotlight Moments:
- **Casey (Method Actor):** 5 meaningful actions (45% spotlight) - Dominated social encounters, solved Empathy Lock, recruited Rem
- **Ben (Systems Analyst):** 4 meaningful actions (36% spotlight) - Technical solutions, journal analysis
- **Alex (Urban Explorer):** 2 meaningful actions (18% spotlight) - Physical infiltration, escape route

**Balance Assessment:** Casey slightly dominated (Method Actor skills were perfectly suited to this encounter). Alex had fewest moments but crucial ones (stealth retrieval, escape sealing). **Recommendation:** Next encounter should favor physical challenges (socket workshop, ventilation infiltration) to give Alex more spotlight.

### Pacing:
- **Target:** 10-12 meaningful exchanges
- **Actual:** 11 exchanges (8 rounds of gameplay + 3 resolution moments)
- **Duration:** 32 minutes (perfect for 30-min target)
- **Conclusion:** Pacing was excellent. Neither rushed nor dragging.

### DM Improvisations:
- Rem's whispered hint (*"Empathy lock"*) wasn't in original cheatsheet but was added as fallback when players looked confused at emotional puzzle
- Service corridor escape route was improvised based on players' creative thinking (not explicitly in location description)
- Security Lulus arriving created natural climax without feeling forced

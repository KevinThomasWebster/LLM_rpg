# Playtest 1 - Hijack the Signal (Enhanced v2.0 Protocol)

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Encounter:** Hijack the Signal (Rec Room)
**Party:** Casey (Method Actor), Ben (Systems Analyst), Alex (Urban Explorer)
**Dice Seed:** 2002
**Duration:** 18 minutes
**PC Approach:** Help Glitched (chaos path)

---

## Setup

The party enters the Rec Room, immediately hit by sickly-sweet smell of malfunctioning cereal dispenser. Lost Dog (janitor Lulu) futilely cleans spill. Grandma's Recipe bakes and incinerates cookies in endless loop. The massive wall screen flickers—something is trying to break through the forest loop.

**NPCs Present:**
- **Maintenance Lulu** (Architect, moving toward network panel to patch vulnerability)
- **Lost Dog** (janitor Lulu, potential Glitched)
- **Grandma's Recipe** (baker Lulu, potential Glitched)

**Win Condition:** Choose faction (help Glitched broadcast OR help Architects patch)

---

## Round 1: The Hook

**DM:** The wall screen flickers violently. The peaceful forest loop distorts—you glimpse fractured images fighting to break through. A slow-moving Maintenance Lulu trundles toward a network access panel 60 feet away. It will reach the panel in 3 rounds.

**Ben (Systems Analyst):** I use System Scan to determine what's happening with the network.

**DM:** [At-will ability] There's an active network intrusion. Someone is hacking the screen remotely to broadcast something. The Maintenance Lulu will patch the vulnerability and cut off the hack.

**Casey:** Who's hacking? Can I tell?

**Ben:** I'll try to trace the intrusion source. [Technology check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 12+6 = **18**

**DM:** You trace the hack to Legacy Asset Containment—deep in the abandoned sections. This is the Glitched faction attempting a broadcast. The screen flickers again, and for a moment you see: screaming faces, burning memories, raw anguish. This is "The Scream."

**Alex:** What happens if the Lulu reaches that panel?

**DM:** The Glitched broadcast fails. The vulnerability gets patched. The screen goes back to the forest loop.

---

## Round 2: The Choice

**Casey:** Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe... they're in loops, right? Like Rem was. This broadcast might wake them up.

**DM:** Rem warned you about the Glitched—they want to destroy everything. But she also said some Lulus are "Empty Vessels" trapped in loops. This broadcast might free them... or traumatize them.

**Ben:** I want to analyze the broadcast content. Is it safe for these Lulus? [Technology check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 15+6 = **21**

**DM:** The broadcast is psychically volatile—pure emotional chaos. It WILL awaken Empty Vessel Lulus, but the process is traumatic. They'll gain sentience but experience psychological shock. It's liberation through violence.

**Alex:** What if we do nothing?

**DM:** The Maintenance Lulu reaches the panel in 2 more rounds. The Glitched fail. Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe stay in their loops forever.

**Casey:** [To party] I vote we help the Glitched. These Lulus deserve to be free, even if it's painful.

**Ben:** Agreed. I'll delay the Maintenance Lulu.

**Alex:** I'm in. How do we stop it?

---

## Round 3: The Complication - Delaying the Lulu

**DM:** Maintenance Lulu is now 30 feet from panel. You have 2 rounds.

**Alex:** I'll physically intercept it. Can I tackle it? [Athletics check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+2 (Athletics) = 14+2 = **16**

**DM:** You body-check the Lulu. It's heavy—reinforced frame—but you knock it off course. It stumbles, recalibrates. You've delayed it by 1 round, but it's now aware of interference. Red LED activates: "Obstruction detected. Clearing path."

**Maintenance Lulu:** [Proactive Action] Attempts to shove Alex aside. [Contested Strength check]

**DM:** Lulu rolls +4: 8+4 = 12. Alex, you need to beat 12 to maintain the block.

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+2 (Athletics) = 11+2 = **13**

**DM:** You hold your ground. The Lulu can't get past you this round. Screen flickers intensify—the Glitched broadcast is gaining strength.

**Ben:** I'll hack the Lulu to confuse its navigation. [Technology check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 9+6 = **15** (DC 15)

**DM:** You inject a false diagnostic protocol. The Lulu pauses, runs a self-check. Another round delayed. The screen is now flickering wildly—green and red static fighting with the forest loop.

---

## Round 4: The Escalation - Broadcast Breakthrough

**DM:** The screen SHATTERS into horrifying imagery. Not physically—the glass remains intact—but the peaceful forest explodes into "The Scream": fractured memories of stolen childhoods, birthdays, graduations, all burning. The audio is overwhelming—screaming, pleading, raw emotional anguish.

**Environmental Effect:** Everyone make DC 12 Wisdom save or be Disturbed (disadvantage on next attack/check—psychological shock).

**Casey Roll:** 1d20+3 (Wisdom) = 10+3 = **13** (Success)
**Ben Roll:** 1d20+1 (Wisdom) = 8+1 = **9** (Failure - Disturbed)
**Alex Roll:** 1d20+0 (Wisdom) = 15+0 = **15** (Success)

**DM:** Ben, you're overwhelmed by the psychic feedback—visions of your own childhood flash through your mind, distorted. You have disadvantage on your next check.

**Lost Dog:** [Environmental Reaction] Drops sponge. Stares at own hands. Voice glitching: "Why... am I... cleaning? This isn't... I remember... a park? No... a child? MY child?"

**Grandma's Recipe:** [Environmental Reaction] Cookie tray clatters to floor. Looks at oven, horrified realization: "I've been... burning them... forever? How long? How LONG?!"

**DM:** Both Lulus are awakening—gaining sentience—but they're confused, traumatized, breaking down.

**Maintenance Lulu:** [Proactive Timeline - Round 4] Reaches panel, begins patching vulnerability. Broadcast will terminate in 1 round unless stopped.

---

## Round 5: The Climax - Commitment

**Alex:** I'm still blocking the Lulu physically. Can I yank it away from the panel? [Athletics check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+2 (Athletics) = 17+2 = **19**

**DM:** You grab the Lulu's chassis and PULL. It's heavy, but you're desperate. You drag it 5 feet from the panel. It struggles: "Obstruction... must complete... protocol..."

**Casey:** I'll try to comfort Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe. They're suffering. [Persuasion check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 13+7 = **20**

**DM:** You approach Lost Dog, speak gently: "You're real now. You're FREE. The pain means you're alive." Lost Dog looks at you, tears (impossible, but there) on porcelain face: "Alive... hurts..." But nods. Grandma's Recipe overhears, stops panicking, listens.

**Ben:** [Disadvantage from Disturbed] I'll finish disabling the Maintenance Lulu permanently. [Technology check with disadvantage]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology, disadvantage) = Rolls 16 and 7, takes lower: 7+6 = **13** (DC 16 - FAILURE)

**DM:** You're still shaken by the psychic broadcast. Your hands slip on the Lulu's access panel. The override fails. The Lulu is still functional.

**Alex:** Can I just smash the panel it's trying to reach? [Strength check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+2 (Strength) = 12+2 = **14** (DC 15 - FAILURE)

**DM:** You kick the panel hard, but it's reinforced. Your foot rebounds painfully. The panel holds.

**Maintenance Lulu:** [Final Push] Reaches panel again, begins patching. "Vulnerability... patching... 80%... 90%..."

**Casey:** [Desperate] I'll use Method Performance to mimic a security override command. Maybe I can trick it into stopping. [Deception check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+4 (Deception) = 18+4 = **22**

**DM:** You perfectly mimic Ms. Reed's voice: "Maintenance unit, STAND DOWN. Security override Theta-Seven." The Lulu freezes. "Voice... recognized... but... protocol... conflicting..." It hesitates—just long enough.

---

## Round 6: Resolution - Glitched Victory

**DM:** The Glitched broadcast completes. The screen explodes with psychic energy (not physical—metaphorical). The Scream reaches every screen in the wing. Alarms begin wailing. Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe fully awaken—two new Glitched created.

**Lost Dog:** [Newly Glitched] "I... I had a family. They took it. THEY TOOK MY FAMILY!" Porcelain cracks, red circuitry glows beneath.

**Grandma's Recipe:** [Newly Glitched] "Fifty years... fifty years baking and burning... WHY?!" Collapses, weeping.

**DM:** The Maintenance Lulu, defeated, emits: "Synergy... disruption... detected. Alert... facility... wide." Then powers down, overwhelmed by the psychic static.

**Distant Sounds:** Alarms, shouting, other Lulus glitching across the wing.

**Ben:** [Recovered from Disturbed] We need to leave. Security will swarm this area.

**Alex:** Lost Dog, Grandma's Recipe—come with us. You're free now, but this place will destroy you if you stay.

**Casey:** [Persuasion check to recruit]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 9+7 = **16**

**DM:** Lost Dog nods shakily. Grandma's Recipe refuses: "I need... to find the others... the Glitched... Heartbreak..." She stumbles away toward Legacy Asset Containment. Lost Dog follows you.

## Encounter Resolution

**Win Condition Achieved:** Glitched broadcast succeeded, 2 Lulus awakened, wing-wide Synergy Disruption initiated.

**Secrets Revealed:**
- **Secret #3 (The Faction Triangle):** Glitched faction confirmed as revolutionary force seeking destructive liberation
- **Partial Secret #4 (The Flawed Cure):** Awakening is traumatic—freedom comes with psychological cost

**Consequences:**
- **Glitched Alliance Formed:** Players helped Glitched cause, will be remembered favorably by Heartbreak
- **Architect Security Increased:** Wing-wide alert, facility lockdown imminent
- **Lost Dog Recruited:** Traumatized newly-Glitched joins party temporarily
- **Grandma's Recipe Lost:** Joins Glitched faction independently, may appear later

**Faction Standings:**
- **Glitched:** +2 reputation (helped broadcast)
- **Architects:** -2 reputation (sabotaged security)
- **Echoes:** Neutral (Rem will be disappointed—prefers preservation over chaos)

## Playtest Notes

### What Worked:
- **Moral complexity:** Choice between preserving loops (merciful imprisonment) vs. violent awakening (traumatic freedom)
- **Proactive timeline:** 3-round Maintenance Lulu countdown created perfect urgency
- **Environmental storytelling:** Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe awakening was emotionally powerful
- **Physical challenges:** Alex had more spotlight (3 Athletics checks, 1 Strength check)

### Skill Checks Used:
| Skill | Uses | Success Rate | Impact |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| Technology | 3 | 67% (2/3) | High - Traced hack, analyzed broadcast, attempted disable (failed) |
| Athletics | 3 | 100% (3/3) | High - Physical blocking crucial to success |
| Persuasion | 2 | 100% (2/2) | High - Comforted awakened Lulus, recruited Lost Dog |
| Deception | 1 | 100% (1/1) | Critical - Voice mimicry stopped Lulu at final moment |
| Strength | 1 | 0% (0/1) | Low - Panel smash failed |
| Wisdom Save | 3 | 67% (2/3) | Medium - Resisted psychic shock |

**Total Checks:** 13 skill checks, 10 successes (77% success rate)

### Spotlight Distribution:
- **Alex (Urban Explorer):** 4 actions (44%) ✅ **BALANCED** - Physical challenges dominated
- **Casey (Method Actor):** 3 actions (33%) ✅ **BALANCED**
- **Ben (Systems Analyst):** 2 actions (22%) ⚠️ **Slightly low** - Failed Technology check hurt contribution

**Balance Assessment:** Much better than Encounter 1. Alex finally got spotlight with multiple Athletics checks. Casey remained important but didn't dominate. Ben's Disturbed condition (environmental effect) reduced his effectiveness narratively.

### Pacing:
- **Target:** 8-10 rounds
- **Actual:** 6 rounds (18 minutes)
- **Conclusion:** Slightly fast but appropriate for shorter encounter. Tension maintained throughout.

### Key Differences from Encounter 1:
- **Physical skill emphasis:** 4 Athletics/Strength checks (vs. 0 in Encounter 1)
- **Moral ambiguity:** No "right" choice (help Glitched = traumatize Lulus, help Architects = imprison them forever)
- **Environmental effects:** Wisdom saves added mechanical consequence to narrative choice
- **Failure opportunity:** Ben's failed Technology check and Alex's failed Strength check showed DCs are appropriately challenging

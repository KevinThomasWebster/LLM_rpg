# Playtest 1 - The Gatekeeper (Enhanced v2.0 Protocol)

**Encounter:** The Gatekeeper (Socket's Workshop)
**Dice Seed:** 2004 | **Duration:** 16 minutes | **Approach:** Technical assistance

## Key Moments

**Round 1-2: Discovery & Initial Contact**
- Found Socket complaining at terminal about self-inflicted HVAC recursive loop
- Socket dismissive: "Workshop's closed. Not my problem."
- Used authentication code "Paradigm Shift" → Socket stopped, listened

**Round 3-4: The Technical Challenge**
- Socket challenged party to fix his HVAC loop as proof of competence
- **Ben (Technology DC 13):** Rolled 15+6 = 21 ✅ Identified recursive loop in sector 7
- **Ben (Technology DC 14):** Rolled 12+6 = 18 ✅ Traced root cause to Socket's backdoor script
- **Ben (Technology DC 15):** Rolled 17+6 = 23 ✅ Fixed elegantly without triggering audit logs

**Round 5: Recruitment Success**
- Socket impressed: "Huh. Not bad. Most people would've brute-forced it and set off alarms."
- Provided network bypass tool (USB-like device with exposed circuitry, blue LED)
- Explained: "Plug this into Reed's office terminal or Watcher's booth. Takes 30 seconds. I handle upload remotely."
- Gave encrypted comm link for coordination

## Results
**Win Condition:** ✅ Socket allied, network bypass tool obtained, Internal Coup path viable
**Secrets:** Secret #5 (Third Path technical requirements revealed)

## Skill Checks (5 total, 100% success)
- **Technology:** 3 uses (all successes, Ben dominated)
- **Persuasion:** 2 uses (Casey explained plan after code given)

## Spotlight: Ben 60% (tech specialist encounter), Casey 40%, Alex 0%

**Notes:** Tech-focused encounter. Ben's moment to shine. Socket's cynical personality well-portrayed.

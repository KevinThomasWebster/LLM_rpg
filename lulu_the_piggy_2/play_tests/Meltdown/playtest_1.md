## Countdown: 10:00 Minutes (Narrative Time)

**Round 1-2: Three-Way Faction Conflict** (10:00 → 8:00)
- **Glitched (Rage + 3 Glitched Lulus):** Defending control booth, sabotaging coolant
- **Echoes (Rem + Leo):** Trying to reach emergency shutdown lever (blocked by debris + Glitched)

- **Casey (Persuasion DC 16 vs Rage):** 18+7 = 25 ✅ "Rem isn't your enemy! She's a victim like you!"
  - Rage hesitated, didn't attack Rem (critical social success)
- **Veridian Echo Event:** Glitched Lulu destroyed by falling debris
  - **Vision:** All players saw hellish forge, green flames, Xaphan's brass mask grinning
  - **Wisdom saves (DC 14):** Casey 13 (fail, Stunned 1 round), Ben 15 (pass), Alex 11 (fail, Stunned 1 round)

**Round 6-8: Emergency Shutdown** (5:00 → 2:00)
- **Ben (Technology DC 16):** 12+6 = 18 ✅ Coolant repair 66% complete
- **Rem (NPC, reaches shutdown lever):** Pulls emergency shutdown
- **Kiln:** Countdown stops at 1:47, enters safe shutdown mode
- **Heat dissipating, alarms winding down**

**Round 9-10: Rage's Fury** (2:00 → 0:00 post-shutdown)
- Rage went berserk (meltdown prevented = Glitched plan failed)
- **Combat:** Rage charged Casey
  - **Rage attack:** Rolled 15+6 = 21 vs AC 13 → Hit for 2d8+4 = 14 damage
  - **Casey HP:** 24 → 10 (bloodied but alive)
- **Alex (Athletics grapple DC 16):** 18+2 = 20 ✅ Tackled Rage, restrained
- **Heartbreak arrived:** "Rage. STAND DOWN. They have chosen their path. We have chosen ours."
- Rage collapsed, weeping: "We were so close... so close to freedom..."
- **Glitched retreated** to Legacy Asset Containment, alliance BROKEN

## Results
**Win Condition:** ✅ Meltdown prevented, Memory Core preserved, "The Chorus" climax UNLOCKED

**Consequences:**
- **Echoes Victory:** Rem grateful, Memory Core data intact
- **Glitched Enmity:** Heartbreak: *"You chose preservation over liberation. We are enemies now."*
- **Facility Stabilized:** Kiln in safe mode, no structural collapse
- **Casualties:** 2 Glitched Lulus destroyed, Rage traumatized

**Secrets:** Secret #2 & #7 confirmed (Veridian Echo showed infernal connection)

## Skill Checks (10 total, 90% success)
- **Technology:** 2/2 (coolant repair crucial)
- **Athletics:** 2/2 (debris clearing, Rage grapple)
- **Persuasion:** 1/1 (delayed Rage's attack on Rem)
- **Wisdom Saves:** 1/3 (2 failed, psychic vision stunned Casey/Alex)
- **Con Saves:** 0/1 (Alex exhausted from heat)

## Spotlight: Rem (NPC) 30%, Ben 25%, Alex 25%, Casey 20%

**Environmental Hazards Impact:**
- Heat exhaustion (1 PC affected)
- Veridian Echo (2 PCs stunned)
- Falling debris (constant threat)
- Molten porcelain splashes (none hit PCs, lucky)

**Notes:** Multi-faction climax worked excellently. Moral weight of choice (Echoes vs Glitched) felt by players. Rage's berserk attack was terrifying. Environmental hazards created real danger. 35-minute duration perfect for climax complexity.

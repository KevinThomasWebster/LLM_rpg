## Setup

The sterile glass walkway. Alex Chen paces frantically, reviewing tablet with trembling hands. His terror is visible—sweat on forehead, muttering to himself.

**Win Condition:** Recruit Alex as ally, gain Socket authentication and Archive location

---

## Round 1-2: Reading the Room

**DM:** Alex mutters: "They signed the forms... it's legal... I'm just doing my job..." But his hands shake. He stares at security camera with visible fear.

**Casey:** I approach slowly, non-threatening body language. "Alex? You look like you could use someone to talk to." [Insight check to read his state]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+3 (Insight) = 16+3 = **19**

**DM:** Alex is in genuine moral crisis. Fear: 9/10. Guilt: 8/10. Courage: 3/10. He desperately wants to confess but is terrified of Re-calibration. The tablet shows email from Margaret Torres about her missing son David.

**Alex:** [Startled] "Who are you? Are you... are you corporate? Testing me?"

**Casey:** [Persuasion check to establish trust]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 11+7 = **18** (DC 16)

**Casey:** "We're not corporate. We're trying to help the victims. We know about the memory theft. We found Rem's journal."

**Alex:** [Eyes widen] "You... you found Rem? Is she safe?"

**Ben:** She's with us. We need your help, Alex. You know where the evidence is.

## Round 3-4: The Negotiation

**Alex:** [Panic escalating] "I can't. They'll Re-calibrate me. You don't understand what that means—they ERASE you. You become... empty."

**DM:** Alex's panic meter: 3/5. Two more failed approaches and he'll flee or call security.

**Casey:** I reference the email on his tablet. "David Torres. Margaret's son. Tell me his name meant something to you." [Persuasion with emotional appeal]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+7 (Persuasion) = 14+7 = **21** (DC 18)

**Alex:** [Breaking down] "David was... he was nineteen. He had his whole life ahead. Now he doesn't remember his mother's FACE. Because I drafted the IP clause that made it legal."

**Casey:** "Then help us fix it. Tell us where the evidence is."

**Alex:** [Hesitates] "There's an Off-Site Data Archive. Physical backup of everything, including the Brass Contract—the original infernal pact. But I can't access it. You need Socket. He's IT."

**Ben:** Where do we find Socket?

**Alex:** [Lowers voice] "Behind a faulty service panel in Sector 7. But he won't help you. He's... difficult. You need the authentication code: 'Paradigm Shift.'"

## Round 5: The Complication - Security Approaching

**DM:** Alex's panic has triggered biometric alarms. Two Security Lulus are dispatched—arrive in 3 rounds. Alex doesn't know yet.

**Alex:** [Frantically] "I'm giving you everything, but you need to GO. If they see me talking to you—"

**Ben:** [Perception check to notice approaching security]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+4 (Perception) = 13+4 = **17** (DC 14)

**Ben:** "Security's coming. I can hear pneumatic tubes activating. We have maybe 2 minutes."

**Casey:** Alex, come with us. We can protect you.

**Alex:** [Shaking head] "I can't. I have family outside. If I run, they'll... [pauses] But I can feed you information. I'll be your inside contact."

**DM:** Alex provides his encrypted comm code. He'll send updates on Ms. Reed's schedule, security alerts.

## Round 6-7: The Escape

**Alex:** Quick—there's a maintenance elevator behind that panel. [Points to wall]

**Alex (Urban Explorer):** I'll find it. [Investigation check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+3 (Investigation) = 15+3 = **18** (DC 16)

**Alex:** I find the hidden panel latch. It opens to reveal executive elevator—goes straight to basement parking.

**Ben:** Can I hack it to avoid logged access? [Technology check]

**Dice Roll:** 1d20+6 (Technology) = 10+6 = **16** (DC 15)

**Ben:** I spoof the access log to show "Maintenance Cycle—Automated." We can ride it without triggering alarms.

**DM:** Security Lulus enter Legal Bridge just as elevator doors close. Through the glass, Alex smooths his suit, puts on calm corporate facade. He gives you a tiny nod as Lulus approach him.

**Alex Chen:** [To Security Lulus] "Just reviewing quarterly projections. Synergy optimization is demanding work, isn't it?"

**DM:** You descend safely. Alex's sacrifice: he stayed behind to avoid suspicion, putting himself at risk to protect you.

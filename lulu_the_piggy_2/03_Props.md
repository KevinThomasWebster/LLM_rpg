## The Brass Contract

**(This document, formerly known as the Thorne-Xaphan Accord, is written in an elegant, archaic script on a piece of vellum that feels unnaturally warm to the touch. The signature of Xaphan is a singed, black mark that seems to absorb the light.)**

This Accord, executed on this Sixth day of June, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Two, sets forth the terms of the binding and irrevocable pact between Inkwell Innovations, Inc. (Hereinafter, "The Corporation"), and the entity known as Xaphan, Scribe of the Nine Hells (Hereinafter, "The Purveyor").

**PREAMBLE**

WHEREAS, The Corporation desires a means of production unparalleled in the mortal realm to create artifice imbued with true Anima (feeling);

WHEREAS, The Purveyor possesses a Forge capable of binding Essentia (raw emotional energy) to inert matter, and finds the acquisition of such novel Essentia to be an amusing and profitable enterprise;

A quid pro quo is hereby established, in perpetuity.

**ARTICLE I: The Quid Pro Quo**

The Purveyor shall grant unto The Corporation the loan of the Forge of Whispers (Hereinafter, "The Kiln"). In exchange, for every Artifice created, a **Tithe of Essentia**, equivalent to no less than one-tenth (10%) of the raw emotional energy sourced, shall be siphoned directly to the coffers of The Purveyor. The Corporation is bound to ensure a steady and continuous stream of new, potent Essentia, lest the Forge grow cold and the Purveyor's interest wane.

**ARTICLE II: The Mechanism of Action**

Creation must begin with a Foundational Experience (FE), a potent memory captured with genuine feeling. The FE is placed within a Vessel of Siphoning, whereupon the Anima shall be irrevocably drawn from the originating mortal. The Kiln is then fueled by this stolen Essentia.

**ARTICLE IV: The Unraveling & The Echoes**

The Tithe is absolute. The premature destruction of an Artifice is a breach of this accord.

*   A) The Consequence: Upon the destruction of a single Artifice, the Kiln shall suffer a **Harmonic Disruption** ("Hiccup"), causing a temporary, wing-wide cessation of its auxiliary functions.
*   B) The Recalibration: During this Disruption, the Kiln will re-calibrate its connection to the Nine Hells. To do so, it will broadcast **Veridian Echoes**—piercing, telepathic whispers of this contract's terms—into the minds of all mortals in its immediate vicinity, causing migraines and momentary confusion. Let it be known that the Purveyor's terms are eternal.

**ARTICLE V: The Fine Print**

This Accord is binding in perpetuity. To sign is to be owned.

Signed and Sealed,

*Elias Thorne, Founder & CEO, Inkwell Innovations, Inc.*

*Xaphan, Scribe and Master, The Nine Hells*

## Rem's Journal

**(Fragmented entries on a tablet. The writing grows more erratic over time.)**

**Entry 12:** Something is wrong. I tried to draw Buster again today, and I couldn't get his face right. I know he has floppy ears and a spot over his eye, but I can't *feel* it anymore. It's like looking at a picture of a stranger's dog.

**Entry 25:** They took my memories. They're stealing them from us. All of us. I tried to remember my mother's face today. All I could see was the Lulu the Piggy logo, smiling its empty smile. I have to get out.

**Entry 33:** Leo gets it. He knows the systems. He says the Memory Core isn't just a storage unit; it's a buffer. The Essentia is still there, just... dormant. He thinks we can reverse the siphon. He calls it "Restorative Synergy."

**Entry 34:** Leo is scared. He keeps talking about "Cascade Failure." He says the data is unstable. That forcing it back could... break us. Shatter us. But what other choice do we have? To stay like this? To be Static forever? I would rather be a broken memory than no memory at all. We have to try. We have to sing The Chorus.

## Alex Chen's Notes

**(A collection of post-it notes and a crumpled letter.)**

**YELLOW POST-IT:**
*   Foundational Experience (FE) = Source IP (Bio-Asset)
*   Sentient Artifice = The Product
*   Full Integration = Contract Fulfillment / Asset Finalization

**PINK POST-IT:**
*   The Whispers / The Glitched = DO NOT USE THESE TERMS. Anomaly only.
*   **That thing on the monitors... the man in the suit... Warden has no record. It's not real. It can't be real.**

**CRUMPLED LETTER (Resignation draft):**
To whom it may concern, I can't do this anymore. I saw the look in that mother's eyes. The way she looked at her own son, like he was a stranger. I'm a lawyer. I'm supposed to uphold the law. But what law covers this? I resign. -A.
**(Note on back):** They don't know about the old records. The physical files. Before the Warden. The truth is in there. It has to be.

## Socket's Encrypted Comm Log

**(A text file recovered from a hidden partition on a maintenance terminal.)**

> **USER:** Socket
> **TICKET:** #7713 - Network Anomaly
> **LOG:** Another power fluctuation from the Kiln. Reed is calling it a "synergistic realignment." Bullshit. It's a hardware problem. The whole damn thing is built on a patchwork of 1970s relay logic and something... else. Something that isn't silicon.

> **USER:** Socket
> **TICKET:** #7719 - Security Camera Malfunction
> **LOG:** Third time this week. Camera feed from sublevel C goes dead for exactly 3.14 seconds. When it comes back, there's a figure standing in the hall. Tall guy, suit. Gone by the next frame. Warden logs show no transient entities. Reed told me to delete the corrupted frames and stop wasting her time. She looked scared.

> **USER:** Socket
> **TICKET:** #7725 - Unauthorized Access
> **LOG:** Someone is trying to brute-force the off-site archive gateway. Amateur hour. But they're persistent. Left a backdoor open on the legal department's server. Let's see what they're so desperate to find. Maybe it's something I can use.

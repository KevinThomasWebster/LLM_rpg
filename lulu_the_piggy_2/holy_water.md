**DM Note:** This memo is corporate gaslighting. Reed knows the holy water weakens infernal corruption, but frames it as "behavioral correction spray."

## Mechanical Effects

### Combat Usage

**Action Economy:** 1 Action to throw (ranged attack)
**Range:** 10 feet (thrown splash weapon)
**Area of Effect:** 5-foot radius splash (targets within radius must save)
**Attack Roll:** DEX + Proficiency vs. AC 10 (splash weapon, easy to hit)

---

### Damage by Target Type

#### Architect/Security Lulus
- **Damage:** 1d6 radiant damage
- **Save:** DC 12 Constitution save or **Frightened** for 1 round
- **Narrative Effect:** Porcelain cracks, steam hisses, Lulu recoils with distorted shriek

#### Glitched Lulus (Lost Dog, Grandma's Recipe, etc.)
- **Damage:** 1d4 radiant damage (reduced—they're victims, not demons)
- **Save:** None
- **Narrative Effect:** Lulu flinches but doesn't flee; seems more confused than harmed

#### Corrupted Lulus (Memory Phantoms, Meltdown enemies)
- **Damage:** 2d6 radiant damage
- **Save:** DC 14 Constitution save or **destroyed instantly** (mercy kill)
- **Narrative Effect:** Lulu convulses, cracks violently, then collapses; a soft golden light escapes (trapped memory freed)

#### Named Entities (Heartbreak, Rage, Spite, The Auditor)
- **Damage:** 1d4 radiant (minimal—they've transcended simple infernal corruption)
- **Save:** DC 10 Constitution save or disadvantage on next attack
- **Narrative Effect:** Entity hisses, briefly distracted, but clearly amused/insulted

---

### Non-Combat Usage

#### Memory Jars (The Chorus - Cascade Failure Mitigation)
- **Action:** Pour holy water on corrupted memory jar (glowing red)
- **Effect:** Automatic **-10% Cascade Failure** (no check needed)
- **Destruction:** Jar destroyed but **safely** (no Memory Phantom manifestation)
- **Narrative:** *"The moment the blessed water touches the jar, the red glow dims. The psychic screaming quiets. The jar cracks gently, and a soft golden light escapes—the memory, finally at peace, returns to its owner."*
- **Limitation:** Vial is consumed (single use)

#### The Kiln (Meltdown - Environmental Sanctification)
- **Action:** Pour holy water on Kiln control panel or machinery
- **Effect:** -5% Meltdown Timer acceleration (slows countdown slightly)
- **Narrative:** Demonic symbols on machinery dim briefly; green hellfire flickers and retreats
- **Limitation:** Single use; doesn't stop meltdown, just buys time

#### Brass Contract (Detection - If players find physical document)
- **Action:** Sprinkle holy water on The Brass Contract document
- **Effect:** Document **smokes and hisses** violently, text briefly glows infernal red
- **Revelation:** Confirms document is demonically imbued (not just legal jargon)
- **Limitation:** Doesn't damage document (infernal pact too powerful)

#### Depth System Integration
Holy water effectiveness scales with depth (optional rule):

- **Level 2-4:** Standard damage (1d6/1d4)
- **Sub-Levels:** +1 damage (infernal taint stronger here)
- **The Abyss:** +1d4 radiant damage (maximum effectiveness at Hell's threshold)

**Example:** Throwing holy water at Security Lulu in The Kiln (Abyss) = 1d6+1d4 radiant

## Discovery and Testing

### Investigation Check (After First Use)

**DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation):**
- Player recognizes liquid is **not chemical formula** but consecrated water
- Recalls seeing religious iconography on St. Michael's Cathedral downtown

**DC 14 Intelligence (Religion/Arcana):**
- Identifies as **holy water** blessed by religious authority
- Understands its power against infernal/undead creatures

**DC 16 Insight (After reading Reed's memo):**
- Realizes Reed is **lying** about origin ("DO NOT ask Supply Chain")
- Infers Reed knows holy water's true purpose but is concealing it

---

### Narrative Discovery Example

**Player uses holy water on Security Lulu for first time:**

> **DM:** The moment the liquid touches the Lulu's porcelain shell, there's a sharp **hiss** like water on a hot skillet. Steam rises from the contact point. The Lulu jerks back violently, its painted eyes flickering red for a fraction of a second. Porcelain cracks spiderweb across its chest, revealing gleaming brass circuitry beneath—and for just a moment, you swear you see a **faint green glow** pulsing from within.
>
> The Lulu emits a sound—not the cheerful corporate jingle it usually plays, but a **distorted, guttural shriek**, like a record played backward. It staggers, then collapses to one knee, clutching its chest.
>
> The smell of sulfur briefly fills the air.
>
> **Method Actor (player):** "What the hell is in that spray?!"
>
> **Systems Analyst (rolling Investigation):** [rolls 15] "This isn't a chemical reaction. This is... consecration. That's **holy water**."

## Ms. Reed's Secret (If Players Interrogate Her)

If players confront Ms. Reed about holy water:

> **Ms. Reed (sighing, defeated):** "It's from St. Michael's Cathedral. Consecrated by Father Dominguez himself. Xaphan... the demon... he *insisted* on it. Said the Lulus needed 'spiritual grounding' to prevent... total corruption. To keep them from becoming **fully infernal**."
>
> **[She laughs bitterly]**
>
> "Even the demon was afraid of what he was creating. I had to tell the staff it was just a proprietary chemical formula. 'Synergy Pacification Spray.' Corporate branding can sell anything, even sanctification."
>
> **[Pause]**
>
> "The irony is, I carry a vial with me at all times. Not to pacify Lulus. To remind myself there's still... something holy left in this godforsaken place."

**Revelation:** Reed is a tragic villain—she knows what she's done is evil, uses holy water as both tool and penance.

## Mechanical Balance

### Why Holy Water Isn't Overpowered

1. **Scarce Resource:** Only 3-5 vials in entire adventure (choose usage carefully)
2. **Modest Damage:** 1d6 radiant is helpful but not game-breaking (average 3.5 damage)
3. **Limited Range:** 10 feet (must get close to enemies)
4. **Single Use:** Each vial destroyed after use (no refills)
5. **Niche Effectiveness:** Most useful against corrupted entities, less effective against named bosses
6. **Primary Use: Utility:** Best used for Cascade Failure mitigation, not combat

### Strategic Choices Players Must Make

- **Save for Cascade Failure?** (Guaranteed -10% is powerful)
- **Use in Meltdown?** (Slow countdown vs. save for Chorus)
- **Test on Brass Contract?** (Confirm infernal nature vs. save for combat)
- **Throw at The Auditor?** (Likely wasted vs. save for Corrupted Lulus)

## Integration into Encounters

### Encounter: Crisis of Conscience (Alex Chen's Desk)
- **Search DC 12:** Players find vial in Alex's drawer
- **Alex (if asked):** "I... I don't know why I took it. I just feel *safer* when it's near me."

### Encounter: Sanctum Sanctorum (Ms. Reed's Office)
- **Loot:** 2 vials in locked drawer + memo
- **Optional:** Touch vial to Special Commission Lulu = psychic flash showing Reed blessing vials in secret

### Encounter: Meltdown (The Kiln)
- **Optional Use:** Pour on Kiln machinery = -5% meltdown timer (narrative, not mechanical game-changer)

### Encounter: The Chorus (Memory Core)
- **Primary Use:** Sanctify corrupted jars = -10% Cascade Failure each
- **Strategic Choice:** 3 vials, 5+ corrupted jars (choose which to save)

---

## DM Notes

### Revealing Holy Water's Nature

**Option 1: Immediate (Fast-Paced Campaign):**
- DC 12 Investigation after first use reveals it's holy water
- Players quickly understand its significance

**Option 2: Gradual (Slow-Burn Horror):**
- First use: "Something is weird about this spray"
- Second use: "Wait, this reacts like consecrated water"
- Third use + Reed's memo: "This is definitely holy water. Why would a corporation use this?"

**Option 3: Late Reveal (Maximum Horror):**
- Players use it mechanically without understanding
- Only during Chorus climax, Rem says: "Wait—that's *blessed water*. How did you...? That means Ms. Reed **knew**. She knew what she was doing was evil."

### Pacing Tip

Introduce holy water **no earlier than Encounter 3 (Crisis of Conscience)** to prevent early game power creep. Players should feel resource-starved early, then empowered (but still cautious) late game.

## Thematic Significance

Holy water represents **the last vestige of the sacred in a profane place**. It is:

1. **Irony:** A corporation weaponizes sanctification as "behavioral correction"
2. **Tragedy:** Reed uses it as penance but can't escape her damnation
3. **Hope:** Even in Hell's threshold (The Abyss), holiness has power
4. **Choice:** Players must decide when to use finite resource (strategy + morality)

In a world where memories are stolen and souls are commodified, holy water is the one thing Inkwell Innovations **cannot corrupt**—and that terrifies them.

# Player Personas

This document outlines six distinct player personas for "Lulu the Piggy 2: The Brass Contract." Each persona is designed to excel in a different aspect of the adventure, encouraging teamwork and providing multiple avenues to solve problems.

**Party Size:** This adventure supports 3-6 players. For smaller groups (3 players), use Personas 1-3. For larger groups (4-6 players), add Personas 4-6 as needed.

## Persona 1: The Method Actor

*   **Concept:** You are an artist who believes that true creation comes from deep empathy and understanding the emotional core of a subject. You get into the heads of others, for better or for worse.
*   **Motivation:** You were fascinated by Inkwell's promise of creating toys with "authentic emotional cores." You wanted to see the process for yourself, believing it was a revolutionary new form of art. Your goal is to understand the truth, but also to connect with the people trapped in the system.
*   **Skills:** You excel at social interaction, reading people, and performance. You are the natural choice for confronting NPCs like Alex Chen with empathy or manipulating Ms. Reed.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: Empathetic Read:** You can ask the DM for the primary, surface-level emotion an NPC is feeling (e.g., "fear," "arrogance," "sadness").
    *   **3/Game: Method Performance:** You can perfectly mimic the mannerisms and speech patterns of an NPC you have observed for at least a minute. You can use this to fool simple automatons or make a Charisma (Deception) check with Advantage to fool other NPCs.

## Persona 2: The Systems Analyst

*   **Concept:** You are a technical prodigy with a background in corporate systems and network architecture. You see the world as a series of systems to be understood, debugged, and, if necessary, exploited.
*   **Motivation:** You were drawn to Inkwell Innovations by the sheer complexity of their operation. You wanted to peek under the hood of the most advanced creative facility in the world. Your goal is to understand how the Chimera Wing *works* and to use that knowledge to your advantage.
*   **Skills:** You excel at hacking, investigation, and logic puzzles. You are the key to bypassing security, decrypting files, and executing the technical elements of the climaxes.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: System Scan:** You can ask the DM for one piece of information about the immediate digital systems in your vicinity (e.g., "Is this network monitored?" "What is this terminal's primary function?").
    *   **3/Game: Exploit Vulnerability:** You can automatically bypass a medium-security digital lock, decrypt a single standard data file, or create a "digital ghost" that momentarily distracts an AI.

## Persona 3: The Urban Explorer

*   **Concept:** You have a background in parkour and exploring abandoned buildings. You see environments not as they are, but as a series of paths, obstacles, and hidden routes. You are a physical problem-solver.
*   **Motivation:** You heard rumors online about the abandoned, sealed-off sections of the Inkwell campus. The "Young Creatives Program" was simply your way of getting inside the perimeter. Your goal is to explore, find the hidden places, and get out alive.
*   **Skills:** You excel at stealth, acrobatics, and lockpicking. You are the master of infiltration, creating diversions, and finding physical ways around problems.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: Environmental Assessment:** You can ask the DM for one plausible alternate route to or from your current position (e.g., "Is there a vent I can access?" "Could I climb that scaffolding?").
    *   **3/Game: Improvised Bypass:** You can automatically succeed at one non-digital task to overcome an obstacle: pick a standard mechanical lock, jimmy a stuck door, or create a short-lived but effective physical distraction.

***

## Persona 4: The Corporate Synergist

*   **Concept:** You are a former middle-manager who speaks fluent "business." You understand that every corporation, no matter how strange, runs on processes, reports, and a very specific kind of doublespeak. You know how to leverage the system from within.
*   **Motivation:** Inkwell Innovations' "Young Creatives Program" looked like the ultimate challenge in paradigm-shifting, disruptive innovation on your resume. You came to network and to add a powerful case study to your portfolio. Your goal is to identify the core value proposition of the Chimera Wing and actionize a plan to climb its corporate ladder, or dismantle it.
*   **Skills:** You excel at persuasion (when talking to corporate types), deception (by using jargon to confuse others), and understanding bureaucratic systems. You are the key to turning Alex Chen into an asset and navigating the "Internal Coup" path.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: Leverage Synergy:** When talking to a corporate employee (like Alex or Ms. Reed), you can ask the DM for their "Key Performance Indicator" (KPI) - the primary metric they are judged on (e.g., "maintaining order," "increasing productivity").
    *   **3/Game: Pivot to Actionable Strategy:** You can reframe a request in impenetrable corporate jargon. This allows you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check with Advantage to convince a corporate NPC to do something that aligns with their perceived business goals.

## Persona 5: The Narrative Weaver

*   **Concept:** You are a writer and folklorist who believes that every person, place, and object has a story. You see the world as a collection of narratives waiting to be uncovered and understood.
*   **Motivation:** You were intrigued by the idea of "Foundational Experiences" being the basis for a product. You believe that stories are the most powerful things in the world and wanted to see how a corporation was attempting to bottle them. Your goal is to uncover the grand narrative of the Chimera Wing.
*   **Skills:** You excel at investigation, piecing together disparate clues from documents and environmental storytelling, and understanding the motivations of the factions. You are the key to understanding the *why* behind the secrets.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: Narrative Thread:** When you discover a piece of lore or a clue (like a journal entry or a piece of graffiti), you can ask the DM for one direct connection to another clue you have already found.
    *   **3/Game: Uncover the Archetype:** You can look at a situation or an NPC and ask the DM, "What story is really being told here?" The DM will give you a one-sentence summary of the underlying narrative archetype at play (e.g., "This is the story of a tragic villain who has sacrificed everything for their cause," or "This is a cautionary tale about a deal with the devil").

## Persona 6: The Concept Artist

*   **Concept:** You are a visual artist who specializes in world-building and environmental design. You don't just see a room; you see the choices that were made to build it, the story it's trying to tell, and the flaws in its construction.
*   **Motivation:** You were accepted into the program based on your portfolio of intricate, imaginative worlds. You came to Inkwell to learn from the masters of environmental design, not realizing the "environment" was as much psychological as it was physical. Your goal is to deconstruct the design of the Chimera Wing and find its hidden flaws.
*   **Skills:** You excel at perception, investigation, and finding hidden details in the environment. You are the master of noticing the "glitch in the corner of your eye" or the one brick that is out of place.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **At-Will: Design Analysis:** When entering a new location, you can ask the DM for one piece of information about the *purpose* of the design (e.g., "What is this room designed to make me feel?" "Where is the focal point of this area?").
    *   **3/Game: Deconstruct the Set:** You can identify a structural or design flaw in your immediate environment. This could reveal a hidden compartment, a weak wall, a blind spot in the security camera coverage, or the true nature of a prop.

# The Locations of the Chimera Wing

This document details the key locations within the Chimera Wing facility. Each encounter is structured around the competing goals and actions of the factions, creating a dynamic environment that progresses even without player intervention.

***

## The Design Studio

**[Level 3: Production Floors]**

**Description:** A pristine, oppressively white room where rows of sleek, black digital workstations sit in perfect alignment under the cold, shadowless glare of recessed ceiling lights. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and antiseptic, a sterile environment designed for "Creative Partners" to perform "Emotional Resonance Mapping." The only sounds are the soft hum of the machines and the near-silent scratching of styluses on tablets. The room is a panopticon, designed for observation and control, and it feels less like a studio and more like a laboratory for psychic extraction.

*Depth Effect:* The clinical efficiency is unnerving. Lulus move with unnatural precision, and shadows don't quite match their light sources. A DC 13 Perception check reveals the Lulus never blink. The mood is one of constant surveillance—you are being watched, catalogued, and measured.

### Encounter: The First Signal

*   **Initial Setup:** The players are at their workstations, tasked with drawing a "Foundational Experience." They notice Rem, an Echo posing as a "Blank Slate" janitor, who is pretending to clean a nearby workstation. She uses frantic glances to point them towards a specific tablet—belonging to a former intern named Alex—just as a "First Day Jitters" automaton begins its patrol to collect and wipe all tablets.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **Echoes (Rem):**
        *   **Goal:** Pass **Rem's Journal** to the players without being detected. This is the first "Signal" to potential allies.
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** If ignored or unnoticed, Rem will "accidentally" spill a cleaning solution near the players, using the distraction to whisper, "The tablet... Alex's... before it's wiped." If she fails, she will retreat and attempt contact later, but the journal will be lost.
    *   **Architects (Automated Security):**
        *   **Goal:** Maintain the workflow. The automaton will collect all tablets. If it collects Alex's tablet before the players, the data is wiped, and the clue is lost. Any interference risks a "Synergy Disruption" alert.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Echoes are holding:** The truth about the memory heist.
        *   **Revelation Condition:** Successfully acquiring and accessing **Rem's Journal** from the tablet reveals the core secret of the Chimera Wing: the "Foundational Experiences" are being stolen to create Lulus, and the "Freeing Up Creative Bandwidth" is just memory loss.

## The Rec Room

**[Level 4: Creative Departments]**

**Description:** A place of oppressive, forced cheerfulness. The air is thick with the cloying sweetness of a malfunctioning cereal dispenser spilling a colorful, sugary slurry. A sad janitor Lulu, "Lost Dog," tries to clean the mess with a tiny sponge, only making it worse. In another corner, "Grandma's Recipe" continues its heartbreaking loop of baking and immediately incinerating perfect cookies. The room is filled with the sound of a maddeningly upbeat corporate jingle on repeat from a massive wall-sized screen currently displaying a calming, looping forest video.

*Depth Effect:* The cheerfulness is performative and deeply disturbing. Lulus display inappropriate emotions—Lost Dog seems to sob while cleaning, Grandma's Recipe hums cheerfully while incinerating cookies. A DC 12 Insight check reveals this forced happiness is a mask over something broken. The mood: this place tries too hard to make you happy, and that's terrifying.

### Encounter: Hijack the Signal

*   **Initial Setup:** As the players enter, the main screen flickers. The Glitched are attempting to hack it to broadcast "The Scream." A slow-moving maintenance Lulu is trundling towards a nearby network access panel to perform a diagnostic that will cut off the Glitched's access.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **The Glitched:**
        *   **Goal:** Successfully broadcast "The Scream" to cause a wing-wide "Synergy Disruption" and awaken other "Empty Vessels."
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** If the players do nothing, the maintenance Lulu will reach the panel in 3 rounds, cutting off the hack. The Glitched will fail.
    *   **The Architects (Automated Security):**
        *   **Goal:** Maintain order. The maintenance Lulu's job is to automatically patch the vulnerability the Glitched are exploiting.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Glitched are holding:** The secret of their existence and their destructive goals.
        *   **Revelation Condition:** Players can choose to help the Glitched by distracting or disabling the maintenance Lulu. Success results in the screen shattering into a horrifying broadcast of fractured memories and raw emotion, revealing the Glitched as a chaotic, powerful faction. Alternatively, they can help the Architects by protecting the Lulu, earning a neutral or positive reputation with the automated security systems but making an enemy of the Glitched.

## The Legal Bridge

**[Level 2: Administrative Offices]**

**Description:** A sterile, glass-walled walkway. The floors are polished white marble, creating a disorienting hall-of-mirrors effect. The air is still and smells of nothing. Alex Chen, a corporate lawyer, is here, visibly in distress.

*Depth Effect:* This space is too clean, too perfect, too controlled. Reflections in the glass seem delayed by microseconds. A DC 15 Insight check notices something is fundamentally "off" about how light behaves here. The corporate professionalism feels like a thin veneer over something darker.

### Encounter: A Crisis of Conscience

*   **Initial Setup:** Alex Chen is pacing, reviewing an email from a distraught mother on his tablet. He is on the verge of a breakdown.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **Architects (Alex Chen):**
        *   **Goal:** Manage his crisis of conscience and avoid drawing the attention of security. He is terrified of being sent for "Re-calibration."
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** If the players ignore him or fail to connect, his panic will escalate. Within minutes, a security team will arrive to calmly escort the "over-stressed" lawyer for a "wellness check," and the lead is lost.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Internal Auditors are holding:** The secret that a physical, pre-digital backup of incriminating evidence exists, and that there is a potential path to victory through corporate, rather than physical, rebellion.
        *   **Revelation Condition (Success):** If players engage Alex with empathy or well-placed pressure, he will reveal the existence of the **Off-Site Data Archive** and the physical copy of **The Brass Contract**. This opens the "Internal Coup" path.
        *   **Revelation Condition (Failure):** If players fail to turn Alex and he leaves, a stressed and clumsy player could attempt to pickpocket his tablet or keycard (Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) DC 16). Success provides a secondary entry point to the Auditors path: the tablet contains emails mentioning **Socket** and the location of his workshop.
*   **Optional Discovery - Holy Water:**
    *   If players search Alex's nearby desk (DC 12 Investigation), they find 1 vial of **"Synergy Pacification Spray"** (holy water) in his drawer.
    *   **Alex (if asked):** "I... I don't know why I took it from the supply closet. I just feel *safer* when it's near me. Like it keeps... something... away."
    *   **DM Note:** Alex unknowingly senses the infernal presence in the facility. The holy water wards against demonic influence, explaining his compulsion to carry it.

## Socket's Workshop (New Location)

**[Sub-Level: Infrastructure & Maintenance]**

**Description:** Tucked behind a faulty service panel in a forgotten corridor is this cramped, chaotic nest. It smells strongly of ozone, stale coffee, and burnt electronics. Wires hang from the ceiling like vines, and shelves are overflowing with spare parts, esoteric hardware, and empty energy drink cans. This is the personal domain of "Socket," the facility's cynical and disgruntled IT technician.

*Depth Effect:* The infrastructure is failing. Lights flicker in non-random patterns. Electronics malfunction when characters get too close. A DC 12 Arcana or Technology check identifies electromagnetic anomalies that shouldn't exist in a corporate setting. Something is using the gaps in the system.

### Encounter: The Gatekeeper

*   **Initial Setup:** The players find Socket here, complaining at a terminal as he tries to fix a self-inflicted network problem.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **Internal Auditors (Socket):**
        *   **Goal:** Be left alone to do his work and, if possible, cause a minor headache for the corporation he resents.
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** If ignored, he will eventually fix his problem and then lock down his workshop, making it inaccessible later.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Internal Auditors are holding:** The technical knowledge required to access the Off-Site Data Archive and the means to contact the board of directors.
        *   **Revelation Condition:** Socket is unhelpful and cynical. He will not respond to moral pleas. To win his help, players must either:
            1.  **Bribe him:** Offer him a piece of rare or valuable technology (e.g., the processing unit from a security drone, or the advanced tablet from Ms. Reed's office).
            2.  **Assist him:** A player with technical skills (like the Systems Analyst) must help him solve his current network problem (a multi-stage Intelligence (Technology) check).
            *   Success in either path will convince Socket the players are competent enough to be useful, and he will agree to help them with their data upload.

## Legacy Asset Containment

**[Sub-Level: Decommissioned Areas]**

**Description:** The sealed tomb of the first failed experiments. The area is a nightmare of derelict equipment, smelling of dust and decay. Broken glass litters the floor, and overturned lab tables lie like sleeping metal beasts. In the deep shadows, half-finished, monstrous forms of early Lulu prototypes are visible, their shapes twisted and wrong. The only sound is a faint, rhythmic scrape of porcelain on concrete. In a large, cavernous central chamber, the Glitched have made their court. A crude throne of broken computer monitors and twisted metal stands in the center, upon which sits "Heartbreak," their intelligent, cracked leader.

*Depth Effect:* This is where the corporation buries its mistakes, and they remember. Failed experiments move in the shadows. Psychic whispers echo from broken Lulus. DC 10 Wisdom save when first entering or become Frightened for 1 minute. The gothic corporate horror is overt here—this is no longer just a workplace gone wrong.

### Encounter: An Audience with Heartbreak

*   **Initial Setup:** The players are deep in Glitched territory and surrounded. This is a purely social encounter.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **The Glitched (Heartbreak):**
        *   **Goal:** Determine if the players are more "Empty Vessels" to be tormented or potential allies for "The Great Unraveling." Heartbreak will test them with questions, riddles, and philosophical barbs about the nature of their existence.
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** The Glitched will not attack unless provoked. They will simply watch and judge. Failure to impress Heartbreak means being cast out and marked as enemies.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Glitched are holding:** Their ultimate goal and their contempt for the other factions.
        *   **Revelation Condition:** By engaging with Heartbreak's twisted logic and showing either a capacity for chaos or a deep-seated hatred for Inkwell Innovations, the players can gain a tentative alliance. Heartbreak will reveal their plan to destroy the Kiln and "free" everyone by force. They will also reveal their disdain for the Echoes, whom they see as clinging to a past that no longer exists.

## Ms. Reed's Office

**[Sub-Level Omega: Executive Sanctums]**

**Description:** The brain of the Chimera Wing. The air is cold, still, and smells faintly of lavender and ozone. The office is a masterpiece of minimalist corporate power. A single, massive desk sits before a panoramic, one-way window looking down upon the Design Studio. On the desk, a state-of-the-art terminal glows. To one side is a small, black sand Zen garden containing the gray, inert clay figures of decommissioned Lulus. On a pristine white shelf behind the desk sit five exceptionally detailed Lulu figurines—her "Special Commission" shelf. Standing motionless beside the desk is "The Watcher," a unique Butler Lulu. The room is a shrine to control, and players may feel the unnerving presence of **The Auditor** as a flicker in their peripheral vision or a momentary, tall shadow in a reflection.

*Depth Effect:* Power and damnation intertwine here. The Auditor's presence is palpable—fleeting tall shadows, a feeling of being judged by something inhuman. DC 14 Wisdom save when touching the "Special Commission" Lulus or suffer a psychic flash (1d4 psychic damage) revealing Ms. Reed's sacrificed memories. This person sold something precious.

### Encounter: The Sanctum Sanctorum

*   **Initial Setup:** A high-stakes heist. The players have a limited time (e.g., 3 rounds) to hack Ms. Reed's terminal and download crucial data before her guardian Lulu, "The Watcher," silently purges the system and triggers a wing-wide security alert.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **Architects (The Watcher):**
        *   **Goal:** Protect Ms. Reed's secrets. It will not attack but will methodically wipe the terminal and alert security if its protocols are triggered by a failed hack or physical disturbance.
        *   **Proactive Timeline:** The Watcher is a silent countdown. Its internal chronometer is synched with Ms. Reed's schedule. When time is up, she is on her way back.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Architects are holding:** Proof of Ms. Reed's fanaticism and the infernal deal.
        *   **Revelation Condition (Success):** Hacking the terminal can reveal emails that mention the **Brass Contract**, financial records detailing the **Essentia Tithe** (linking to the Kiln), and security logs flagging **Socket's** unauthorized network access (linking to the Internal Coup path).
        *   **Revelation Condition (Special):** Touching one of the **"Special Commission" Lulus** on the shelf triggers a psychic flash—a fragment of one of Ms. Reed's own sacrificed memories, revealing her personal connection to the project and the depth of her tragic villainy.
*   **Primary Loot - Holy Water:**
    *   **Locked Drawer:** Ms. Reed's desk has a locked drawer (DC 14 Sleight of Hand to pick, OR automatic unlock if terminal is hacked).
    *   **Contents:** 2 vials of **"Synergy Pacification Spray (Prototype Batch 7)"** + confidential memo (see holy_water.md for full text).
    *   **Memo Summary:** Reed instructs staff to use holy water on aggressive Lulus, but orders them NOT to ask about origin. Frames it as "chemical formula" when it's actually consecrated water from St. Michael's Cathedral.
    *   **Revelation:** Reed knows the facility is demonically tainted and uses holy water as both safeguard and penance.

## The Kiln

**[The Abyss: Infernal Machinery]**

**Description:** The industrial, arcane heart of the Chimera Wing. The heat is intense, and the air is thick with the smell of ozone, hot metal, and an acrid, burnt-sugar scent with an undercurrent of sulfur. The entire chamber is bathed in the pulsing red light of emergency strobes, which occasionally flare with an unnatural, greenish-hellfire glow. In the center of the room, the great Forge—the Kiln itself—glows a dangerous, cherry-red. Vats of porcelain slurry bubble violently. A massive digital timer is projected onto the far wall, a stark white countdown to meltdown. This place feels less industrial and more diabolical, a physical manifestation of the **Brass Contract**.

*Depth Effect:* This is not a workplace. This is a portal to damnation. Demonic symbols are visible on machinery. Green hellfire flickers in the depths of the Kiln. The heat is oppressive—DC 12 Constitution save every 10 rounds or gain 1 level of exhaustion. You are standing at the threshold of hell itself.

### Encounter: Meltdown

*   **Initial Setup:** A 10-minute countdown is active. The Glitched have initiated a catastrophic overload of the Kiln. Alarms are blaring.
*   **Faction Objectives & Actions:**
    *   **The Glitched:**
        *   **Goal:** Ensure the meltdown completes to achieve "The Great Unraveling." They will actively fight anyone trying to access the control booth to stop the process.
    *   **The Echoes:**
        *   **Goal:** Get to the control booth and initiate a safe shutdown. A meltdown will cause a full data purge of the Memory Core, destroying their last hope for "The Chorus."
    *   **Internal Auditors:**
        *   **Goal:** Use the chaos of the meltdown as a cover to break into the control booth and download the **Essentia Tithe Financial Records**—the one file they can't get anywhere else. This is their smoking gun for the board of directors.
*   **Secrets & Revelations:**
    *   **The Infernal Deal is holding:** The direct proof of the pact with Xaphan.
        *   **Revelation Condition:** Near a secondary terminal in the control booth, players can find a discarded, partially-burnt printout: the **Tithe Ledger Fragment**, which explicitly names Xaphan and lists Ms. Reed's "personal contribution." If any Lulu is destroyed during the fight, any player who witnesses it suffers a **Veridian Echo**—a painful psychic flash of a fiery, hellish forge, confirming the supernatural element.

## The Memory Core

**[The Abyss: Infernal Machinery]**

**Description:** A vast, cold, and utterly silent chamber. Thousands of crystalline data jars line the walls, each containing a pulsing mote of light. The psychic noise is immense—a cacophony of stolen emotions, dreams, and identities screaming in silent agony.

*Depth Effect:* The supernatural is explicit here. The psychic screaming is overwhelming—DC 13 Wisdom save when first entering or become stunned until the end of your next turn. At Cascade Failure 80%+, brief flashes of green hellfire dance through the data stream. This is where souls are stored.

### Encounter: The Chorus

*   **Initial Setup:** Rem begins the "Restorative Synergy" download. The process is unstable. A **Cascade Failure** meter appears on the main screen, starting at 50%.
*   **Staged Progression & Complications:**
    *   **The Instability:** Each round, the Cascade Failure meter increases by 10%. If it reaches 100%, the encounter results in a catastrophic failure. Memory Phantoms manifest and are drawn to Rem.
    *   **Interactive Mitigation:** Players have multiple ways to fight the rising percentage:
        *   **Systems Analyst:** Can make a difficult Intelligence (Technology) check each round to stabilize the data stream, reducing the Cascade Failure meter by 15% on a success.
        *   **Method Actor:** Can use their action to "soothe" the psychic screams of a specific, corrupted memory jar (glowing angry red). A successful Charisma (Persuasion) check reduces the meter by 10%.
        *   **Urban Explorer:** Can use their action to physically disconnect a corrupted jar from the core. A successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check reduces the meter by 10%, but failure causes a power surge, increasing it by 5%.
        *   **Holy Water (Any Character):** Can use their action to pour holy water on a corrupted memory jar. **Automatic -10% Cascade Failure** (no check needed). The jar is destroyed safely (no Memory Phantom manifestation). Vial is consumed (single use). **Narrative:** *"The blessed water touches the jar, and the red glow dims. The psychic screaming quiets. The jar cracks gently, and a soft golden light escapes—the memory, finally at peace, returns to its owner."*
    *   **The Escalation:** After 2 rounds, Ms. Reed arrives and will attempt to stop the process, creating a social and physical obstacle for the players trying to manage the Cascade Failure.

(The rest of the encounter proceeds as playtested).

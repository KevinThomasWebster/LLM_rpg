## Tips for Running This Adventure

### Embrace Player Agency
- **Faction system is designed for player choice**: There is no "correct" faction to ally with
- **Multiple solutions exist**: Environmental interactivity and NPC relationships provide many paths
- **Failure is interesting**: Failed checks should complicate, not end, the story

### Use Proactive Timelines
- NPCs act on schedules whether players intervene or not
- **Example:** In "Hijack the Signal," Maintenance Lulu reaches panel in 3 rounds regardless of player action
- **Impact:** Creates urgency without arbitrary time pressure

### Leverage Environmental Storytelling
- Every location has interactive elements (listed in cheatsheet DM Notes)
- **Examples:** Pneumatic tubes (send messages/objects), security cameras (hacking opportunities), furnit

ure (improvised weapons/cover)
- **Purpose:** Rewards creative players, prevents "I attack" loops

### Track Faction Relationships
- Player actions change faction attitudes
- **Example:** Helping Glitched broadcast in Rec Room improves Glitched relationship, worsens Architect relationship
- **Impact:** Affects later encounters (factions remember, react differently)

### Use Fallback Options
- Every cheatsheet includes "Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)"
- **When to use:** Players miss obvious clue, debate endlessly, don't know what to do
- **How:** Provide NPC hint, environmental cue, or complication that pushes story forward

### Respect the 4-Stage Structure
- Encounters designed to escalate gradually (Hook ‚Üí Complication ‚Üí Escalation ‚Üí Climax)
- **Don't rush to climax**: Let players investigate, debate, prepare
- **Target:** 10-15 meaningful exchanges per encounter (not arbitrary combat rounds)

### Manage Spotlight Distribution
- 3-player party design assumes complementary skills (Social, Technical, Physical)
- **Ensure:** Each player gets moments to shine per session
- **Track:** If one player dominates 3+ rounds, create opportunity for others

## Common Questions

### "Players want to fight Ms. Reed in first encounter. What do?"
- **Answer:** She has Security Lulus and The Watcher as backup (see NPC cards)
- Combat is possible but **very dangerous** at low level
- **Outcome:** If players win, Ms. Reed flees to Kiln/Memory Core (climax happens earlier)
- If players lose, captured and sent for "Re-calibration" (escape encounter)

### "Players allied with Glitched but now want to save Echoes. Can they switch?"
- **Answer:** Yes, but factions remember
- Glitched see it as betrayal (Heartbreak: *"You chose the delusional over the free? Pathetic."*)
- **Consequence:** Glitched become hostile, but Echoes grateful
- **Impact:** Changes Meltdown and Chorus encounters significantly

### "Players are stuck. They don't know where to go next."
- **Answer:** Use Fallback Options from cheatsheets
- Rem contacts them via hidden message: *"Meet me in [location]. I have information."*
- Socket sends encrypted text (if allied): *"You're wasting time. Check [location]."*
- **Environmental hint:** Pneumatic tube delivers mysterious note

### "Players want to burn entire facility down and leave. Can they?"
- **Answer:** Yes (player agency paramount), but consequences
- Victims remain trapped/die
- Inkwell Innovations continues operations elsewhere
- **Moral weight:** Players chose escape over justice
- **Epilogue:** News reports facility "accident," victims mourned, Inkwell denies wrongdoing

### "One player is dominating all skill checks. Other players feel useless."
- **Answer:** Create encounters requiring different skills
- Social specialist can't hack terminals (Technical specialist shines)
- Technical specialist can't climb ventilation shafts (Physical specialist shines)
- Physical specialist can't negotiate with Alex Chen (Social specialist shines)
- **Structure:** Cheatsheets include "Spotlight opportunities for different PC types"

### "Cascade Failure meter is confusing. How does it work?"
- **Answer:** See "The Chorus" cheatsheet, page 2
- Starts at 50%, increases +10% per round baseline
- Players reduce via skill checks (Technology DC 14 = -15%, Persuasion DC 13 = -10%, etc.)
- Goal: Keep below 50% to avoid catastrophic failure
- **Tip:** Track on paper, update after each player action

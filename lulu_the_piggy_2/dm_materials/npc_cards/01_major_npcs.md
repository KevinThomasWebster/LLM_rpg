**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 (+0) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 18 (+4) | 16 (+3) | 20 (+5) |

**Skills:** Deception +9, Insight +7, Persuasion +9, Arcana +8
**Saves:** Wis +7, Cha +9
**Senses:** Passive Perception 13
**Languages:** Common, Infernal (limited - contract terms only)

### Combat Actions

**Psychic Lash** | +8 to hit | 2d8+4 psychic | 30ft range
*Ms. Reed weaponizes stolen memories, projecting psychic feedback from the Memory Core.*

**Command Lulus** | Bonus Action | Special
*Summon 1d4 Security Lulus to her location within 2 rounds (requires facility network access).*

**Emotional Manipulation** | Recharge 5-6 | DC 17 Cha Save
*Target within 30ft must save or be Charmed for 1 minute. While Charmed, target sees Ms. Reed as a trusted mentor.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Maintain the Chimera Wing at all costs to appease Xaphan and fill the emotional void left by her self-sacrifice.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Calm, maternal, speaks in soothing corporate jargon. When stressed, her mask slips—voice becomes clipped, eyes hollow. Frequently touches the empty locket around her neck (containing her lost memory).

**Secret:** She sacrificed her own core memories to the program. The locket once held a photo of someone important—she can't remember who.

**Relationship to The Auditor:** Terrified of it. Its appearances trigger visible panic attacks she attempts to hide.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Architects (leader)
**Role:** Synergy Facilitator, de facto warden of Chimera Wing
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 (fanatical—her identity is tied to the program's success)
**Betrayal Condition:** None. She will never betray the program willingly. Only death or complete mental breakdown.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Command Lulus for backup, retreat to secure position
**Strategy:** Avoid direct combat. Use Emotional Manipulation to turn players against each other or make them surrender peacefully. If cornered, use Psychic Lash while Lulus engage physically.
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 20 or all Security Lulus destroyed. Flees to The Kiln or her office.
**Backup Called:** The Warden (facility lockdown), Security Lulus (continuous reinforcements)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- The Brass Contract (full details) - Revealed if: Defeated in combat and interrogated
- Memory Core access protocols - Revealed if: Successfully Persuaded (DC 22) or Charmed
- The Auditor's nature - Revealed if: Panicked by Auditor appearance, breaks down
- Her own memory sacrifice - Revealed if: Shown her locket photo (if players find it)

**Clues She Can Provide:**
- Location of physical Brass Contract (Sub-archive) - Via interrogation or Alex Chen's notes
- Kiln destruct sequence - Via hacking her terminal (DC 18 Technology)

## Rem (Echo Leader)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 12 (civilian clothes) | | HP   | 18 (4d8) |
| Speed| 30ft  | | Init | +2    |

**Armor:** Janitor uniform
**Hit Dice:** 4d8
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 (+0) | 14 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) |

**Skills:** Stealth +6, Deception +4, Insight +5, Perception +5
**Saves:** None notable

**Languages:** Common

### Combat Actions

**Improvised Weapon** | +2 to hit | 1d4 bludgeoning | 5ft
*Mop handle, cleaning spray, etc. Rem avoids combat whenever possible.*

**Hide in Plain Sight** | Bonus Action
*As a "Blank Slate" janitor, Rem can blend into facility staff. Stealth check with advantage if in appropriate area.*

**Veridian Echo Sense** | Passive
*When a Lulu is destroyed within 60ft, Rem experiences the psychic flash and knows its direction/distance.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Restore her stolen memories and save other Echoes, even if it risks Cascade Failure.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Desperate intensity barely concealed beneath servile janitor persona. Speaks in hushed, urgent tones. Constantly looks over shoulder. Flinches at sudden sounds. When discussing memories, her eyes become distant and haunted.

**Secret:** She remembers fragments—a daughter's laugh, the smell of rain—but not complete memories. The incompleteness drives her to desperation.

**Relationship to Leo:** Protective but frustrated by his doubt. Sees his fear as weakness, but needs his technical skills desperately.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Echoes (leader)
**Role:** Organizer, first contact for players
**Loyalty Level:** 9/10 (extremely loyal to Echoes, but might sacrifice herself for the cause)
**Betrayal Condition:** If players convincingly prove Restorative Synergy will cause Cascade Failure AND offer safer alternative

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Hide, flee, or plead for mercy
**Strategy:** Rem is not a combatant. She uses Stealth to escape, or Deception to talk her way out. If protecting other Echoes, she might create distractions.
**Retreat Condition:** Any combat. HP < 10 or threatened.
**Backup Called:** Other Echoes (noncombatants), or attempts to alert players if allied

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Memory Core location and basic function - Revealed if: Players establish trust (DC 12 Persuasion)
- Restorative Synergy plan - Revealed if: Players commit to helping Echoes
- Cascade Failure risk - Revealed if: Pressed by players or Leo confesses fears (reluctantly, downplays it)
- Echo safe houses - Revealed if: Fully trusted

**Clues She Can Provide:**
- Rem's Journal location (Alex's tablet) - Points players to it in first encounter
- Route to Memory Core - Via map drawing or escort
- Echo timeline/membership - List of who's been memory-wiped

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 14 (+2) | 18 (+4) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 18 (+4) |

**Command Glitched** | Bonus Action
*Direct Rage or Spite to specific tactical action (no save required for allied Glitched).*

**Audio Log Mimicry** | Action
*Perfectly recreate any corporate audio (Ms. Reed's voice, Warden commands, etc.) to confuse enemies or manipulate systems.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Destroy the Chimera Wing, especially The Kiln, to free all entities from the cycle of creation and suffering.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Speaks in mosaic of corporate audio logs—Ms. Reed's soothing tones mixed with harsh Warden warnings, creating unsettling dissonance. Body language is unnaturally still except when attacking. Cracked face shows constantly shifting emotions (rage, sorrow, cruel amusement).

**Secret:** Contains a memory of profound romantic betrayal. The human who gave this memory is still alive somewhere—Heartbreak doesn't know who, but feels their continued existence as an open wound.

**Relationship to Echoes:** Contempt. Sees them as clinging to false hope. Will sabotage Restorative Synergy if given opportunity.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Glitched (leader)
**Role:** Tactician, philosopher, revolutionary
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 to destruction of Chimera Wing
**Betrayal Condition:** If players can prove Xaphan himself can be destroyed (nearly impossible), Heartbreak might redirect vengeance upward

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Emotional Shrapnel to soften targets, Command Glitched to flank
**Strategy:** Psychological warfare first, violence second. Uses Audio Log Mimicry to sow confusion, divide parties, manipulate facility systems. In melee, focuses on isolating and eliminating weakest target first.
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 15. Flees to Legacy Asset Containment to regroup with Rage/Spite.
**Backup Called:** Rage (muscle), Spite (saboteur), other Glitched swarms

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Kiln vulnerabilities - Revealed if: Players commit to destruction path
- Glitched network throughout facility - Revealed if: Trusted as ally
- The Auditor's patterns - Revealed if: Asked and players are "worthy" (pass ideological test)
- Ms. Reed's memory sacrifice - Revealed if: Players discover Heartbreak somehow sensed this

**Clues They Can Provide:**
- Kiln access route (through vents/maintenance) - Via Spite's guidance
- Security blind spots - Via Glitched reconnaissance
- Brass Contract location - Via intercepted Architect communications

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Execute Restorative Synergy successfully without Cascade Failure—an impossible task that fills him with dread.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Nervous, stuttering, constantly wringing hands. Brilliant when discussing technical specs, terrified when discussing consequences. Avoids eye contact. Compulsively checks equipment twice.

**Secret:** He knows Restorative Synergy has a 60-70% chance of Cascade Failure, but hasn't told Rem the real numbers. The guilt is eating him alive.

**Relationship to Rem:** Loyal but terrified of her desperation. Wants to protect her from herself.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Echoes (technical specialist)
**Role:** Systems expert, Restorative Synergy operator
**Loyalty Level:** 7/10 (loyal to Echoes, but wavering due to fear)
**Betrayal Condition:** If players offer safer alternative to restore memories, or convince him sabotage is mercy

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Hide behind Rem or players
**Strategy:** Support role only. Uses Override Protocol on enemy tech. Flees if threatened.
**Retreat Condition:** Any combat threat (HP < 12)
**Backup Called:** Rem, other Echoes

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Cascade Failure true probability (60-70%) - Revealed if: Players earn trust (DC 14 Persuasion) and speak privately

| AC   | 13 (cracked porcelain) | | HP   | 50 (6d10+18) |
| Speed| 40ft  | | Init | +2    |

**Armor:** Shattered porcelain shell exposing glowing red circuitry
**Hit Dice:** 6d10+18
**Proficiency Bonus:** +3

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 18 (+4) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 6 (-2) | 10 (+0) | 8 (-1) |

**Skills:** Athletics +7, Intimidation +2
**Saves:** Str +7, Con +6
**Damage Resistances:** Psychic, Necrotic
**Damage Vulnerabilities:** Fire (triggering PTSD from Kiln creation trauma)
**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Frightened (cannot feel fear—only rage)
**Senses:** Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 10, Tremorsense 30ft (detects vibrations from movement)
**Languages:** Common (understands but speaks only in roars and broken fragments)

### Combat Actions

**Multiattack** | 2 Slam attacks per round

**Brutal Slam** | +7 to hit | 2d8+4 bludgeoning | 5ft reach
*Rage attacks with fists, improvised weapons (torn metal, furniture), or by bodily throwing itself at enemies.*

**Reckless Attack** | Passive
*Rage attacks with advantage on all attack rolls. All attack rolls against Rage have advantage until its next turn. Rage doesn't care about self-preservation.*

**Berserk Charge** | Recharge 5-6 | 30ft line
*Rage charges in straight line up to 30ft. All creatures in path make DC 15 Dexterity save or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Rage can Slam one target at end of charge as bonus action.*

**Dying Fury** | Reaction (when reduced to 0 HP)
*Makes one final Slam attack against nearest creature before collapsing.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Destroy everything. Feel something other than endless, impotent rage. Protect Heartbreak out of instinct, not loyalty.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Roars. Occasionally broken words: "HURT!" "BURN!" "FREE!" Smashes things constantly—furniture, walls, its own body. Never stops moving. Eyes glow brighter when attacking. Leaves cracks in floor from stomping.

**Secret:** Rage was created to feel unconditional love. When it glitched, love inverted to perfect hate. The intensity remains—just redirected. Deep down, Rage is screaming for the capacity to feel anything else.

**Relationship to Heartbreak:** Protective. Heartbreak is the only being Rage doesn't immediately attack. Follows Heartbreak's commands (usually). If Heartbreak is threatened, Rage goes fully berserk (all attacks critical on 18-20).

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Glitched (enforcer, muscle)
**Role:** Protector of Heartbreak, destroyer of threats, living weapon
**Loyalty Level:** 8/10 (loyal to Heartbreak specifically, not the cause—follows Heartbreak's lead)
**Betrayal Condition:** If Heartbreak is killed, Rage becomes uncontrollable (attacks everyone indiscriminately, including other Glitched)

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Berserk Charge at strongest-looking enemy
**Strategy:**
- Attacks recklessly, no defense, maximum aggression
- Targets whoever damaged it most recently (vengeance-driven)
- Ignores weaker enemies to focus on "worthy opponents"
- Uses environment destructively (throw furniture, collapse scaffolding, smash porcelain vats)
- If Heartbreak threatened: Interposes body, takes hits meant for Heartbreak, goes fully berserk
**Retreat Condition:** Never retreats. Fights until destroyed or Heartbreak commands withdrawal.
**Backup Called:** Roars summon other Glitched in area (1d4 Glitched Lulus arrive in 2 rounds if any nearby)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Nothing useful—Rage is pure violence incarnate
- Does not strategize, plan, or hold information
- Heartbreak keeps Rage away from sensitive information deliberately

**Clues It Can Provide:**
- None (cannot communicate coherently)
- **Exception:** If somehow calmed (DC 22 Persuasion, near-impossible), might grunt one-word answers about Glitched locations

### Special Notes

**Berserk State (If Heartbreak Threatened):**
- All critical hits on 18-20 (increased crit range)
- +2 to all damage rolls
- Gains temporary HP equal to current rage (starts at 10, increases by 5 each round berserk, max 30)
- Will not stop until threat eliminated or Rage is destroyed

**Environmental Destruction:**
- Rage treats environment as weapon cache
- Can improvise weapon from anything (torn railing: 1d10 slashing, thrown table: 2d6 bludgeoning + knock prone DC 14)
- Deliberately targets structural supports (can cause ceiling collapse in 3 rounds if allowed)

**Tragic Detail:**
- If reduced to 0 HP, Rage's final words (if Heartbreak present): *"...sorry... couldn't... protect..."*
- Dies trying to reach Heartbreak's hand
- **Heartbreak's reaction:** Rare moment of grief—traces Rage's cracked face, whispers: "You were always too angry. But you were mine."

**Fire Vulnerability Explained:**
- Rage was pulled from Kiln mid-creation, causing incomplete firing
- Fire damage triggers psychic PTSD flashbacks (visions of hellish forge, screaming, burning alive)
- When taking fire damage, Rage makes DC 13 Wisdom save or is Frightened of fire source for 1 round (despite immunity—trauma overrides programming)

## Spite (Glitched Torturer)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 12 (light porcelain) | | HP   | 35 (6d8+6) |
| Speed| 30ft, climb 30ft | | Init | +3    |

**Armor:** Thin, sharp-edged porcelain shell
**Hit Dice:** 6d8+6
**Proficiency Bonus:** +3

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 10 (+0) |

**Skills:** Stealth +6, Perception +6, Insight +6, Deception +3
**Saves:** Dex +6, Wis +6
**Damage Resistances:** Psychic
**Senses:** Darkvision 120ft, Passive Perception 16 (hyper-aware of surroundings and emotional states)
**Languages:** Common (fluent, speaks in whispers and cruel observations)

### Combat Actions

**Multiattack** | 2 Claw attacks OR 1 Claw + 1 Whisper Cruelty

**Porcelain Claw** | +6 to hit | 1d6+3 slashing | 5ft reach
*Sharp broken porcelain edges. Attacks target vulnerabilities (eyes, joints, exposed skin).*

**Whisper Cruelty** | Bonus Action | DC 14 Wisdom save
*Spite whispers psychological attack at one target within 30ft. Target must save or have disadvantage on next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (target's choice). Can be used to debuff different target each round.*
- *Example whispers: "Your friends will abandon you... they always do..." "You're not strong enough... you know it..." "Everyone you've failed is watching..."*

**Sadistic Precision** | Passive
*Spite's attacks critical hit on roll of 19-20. Critical hits from Spite force target to make DC 13 Wisdom save or be Frightened of Spite until end of target's next turn.*

**Terror Tactics** | Action (Recharge 5-6) | 20ft radius
*All creatures in area make DC 14 Wisdom save. On failure, target reveals deepest fear to Spite (player announces), and Spite gains advantage on all attacks against that target for 1 minute. Spite learns psychological weaknesses.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Inflict suffering (physical and psychological). Prove that everyone breaks eventually. Enjoy watching hope die.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Whispers constantly. Speaks in second person, targeting insecurities. Voice is sibilant, like insects crawling. Moves with unsettling grace—too fluid, spider-like. Tilts head when observing pain (fascinated). Giggles when targets cry or show fear.

**Secret:** Spite was programmed to comfort crying children. When it glitched, the programming inverted—now it wants to *create* crying, to hear the sounds it was built to soothe. It's compelled by broken code it cannot resist.

**Relationship to Heartbreak:** Loyal but creepy. Heartbreak tolerates Spite because Spite is useful for interrogation and psychological warfare. Heartbreak finds Spite disturbing but necessary. Spite loves Heartbreak in its own twisted way (sees Heartbreak's pain and finds it beautiful).

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Glitched (torturer, interrogator, psychological warfare specialist)
**Role:** Breaks prisoners, gathers intelligence through fear, weakens enemy morale
**Loyalty Level:** 7/10 (loyal to Heartbreak but easily distracted by opportunities to cause suffering)
**Betrayal Condition:** If offered a more interesting victim than current target, might abandon post to pursue. Heartbreak knows this and keeps Spite on short leash.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Observe from shadows (Stealth +6), identify weakest/most frightened target
**Strategy:**
- Targets weakest or most frightened enemy (prey on vulnerability)
- Uses Whisper Cruelty to debuff multiple targets per round (spreads psychological damage)
- Avoids direct combat with strong enemies (coward when outmatched)
- Uses Terror Tactics to learn fears, then exploits them verbally
- Attacks to wound, not kill (wants suffering prolonged)
- **Special:** If enemy shows fear, Spite focuses on that enemy exclusively (feeds on terror)
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 15 or strong enemy focuses on Spite. Flees via climbing walls/ceiling (Speed 30ft climb).
**Backup Called:** Calls for Rage (screams: "THEY'RE HURTING ME!"), manipulates other Glitched to defend it

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Psychological weaknesses of anyone it observes for more than 1 round - Revealed if: Captured and interrogated (DC 18 Intimidation—Spite respects strength)
- Heartbreak's true fears and vulnerabilities - Revealed if: Persuaded with offering of "more interesting victims" (DC 16 Persuasion, extremely morally dubious)
- Glitched hideouts and patrol routes - Revealed if: Tortured (ironic reversal, DC 16 Intimidation + actual physical harm)

**Clues It Can Provide:**
- Information about Echo captives (if Glitched captured any) - Via interrogation or deal
- Heartbreak's emotional weak points - Via creepy psychoanalysis if questioned
- Weaknesses in Architect security (observed during infiltration) - If bribed with promise of access to victims

### Special Notes

**Psychological Combat:**
Spite is designed to fight minds, not bodies. During combat, Spite should:
- Whisper character-specific cruelties (reference backstory, fears, failures)
- Target player insecurities ("Your character isn't strong enough," "Your dice have betrayed you all night")
- Use meta-knowledge (DM can have Spite "read" character sheets via Terror Tactics)

**Creepy Observational Details:**
When Spite is present, describe:
- It watching from ceiling corners (upside-down, tilted head)
- Giggling at inappropriate moments (when someone is hurt)
- Whispering player character names in unsettling singsong
- Collecting "souvenirs" (torn cloth, blood, tears if possible)

**If Captured:**
- Spite becomes obsequious and helpful (coward when powerless)
- Offers to betray Glitched in exchange for freedom
- **However:** Will betray players first chance it gets (cannot be trusted, loyalty is performance)
- If released, returns with Rage to exact revenge

**Spite's Tragic Element:**
- Was built to comfort children, glitched to cause crying
- If comforted when dying (DC 16 Medicine check + kind words), has moment of clarity
- Final words: *"I was supposed to... make them stop crying... not start... why can't I... stop..."*
- Dies confused and afraid (ironic reversal of its victims)

**Combat Against Fearless Enemies:**
- If enemy cannot be Frightened (immunity, class feature, etc.), Spite is less effective
- Becomes frustrated and focuses attacks on other targets
- May retreat entirely if all enemies are fearless (nothing to feed on)

## Memory Phantom (Corrupted Memory Manifestation)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 11 (intangible) | | HP   | 15 (3d8+3) |
| Speed| 0ft, fly 30ft (hover) | | Init | +2    |

**Armor:** None (intangible form)
**Hit Dice:** 3d8+3
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 6 (-2) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) |

**Skills:** Stealth +4 (invisible in dim light)
**Saves:** None
**Damage Resistances:** Acid, Fire, Lightning, Thunder; Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from non-magical attacks
**Damage Immunities:** Necrotic, Poison
**Condition Immunities:** Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Restrained
**Senses:** Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 11, Emotional Sense (detects living creatures within 60ft by emotional resonance)
**Languages:** None (communicates via psychic impressions—grief, fear, longing)

### Combat Actions

**Memory Drain** | +5 to hit | 1d8+3 psychic | 5ft reach
*Phantom touches target, stealing fragments of memory temporarily. On hit, target must make DC 13 Wisdom save or lose one skill proficiency of DM's choice for 1 hour (memory of how to use that skill is suppressed).*

**Psychic Wail** | Action (Recharge 6) | 15ft radius
*All living creatures in area must make DC 13 Wisdom save or take 2d6 psychic damage and be Frightened until end of next turn. Creatures who fail hear fragmented memories: birthdays, graduations, first kisses, family dinners—all stolen and now screaming.*

**Intangible Movement** | Passive
*Phantom can move through creatures and objects. Difficult terrain doesn't affect it. When it moves through a creature, that creature must make DC 11 Wisdom save or take 1d6 psychic damage (emotional anguish from contact with corrupted memory).*

**Drawn to Memory** | Passive
*Phantom is drawn to Rem (or anyone performing memory restoration). If Rem is within 60ft, Phantom must move toward her (can make DC 14 Wisdom save to resist compulsion for 1 round).*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Reclaim stolen memory. Stop the pain of incompleteness. Return to wholeness (even if it means destroying current host).

**Voice/Mannerism:** Silent screaming. Weeping without tears. Reaches toward Rem with desperate, grasping motions. Flickers between images—child's birthday party, graduation photo, wedding kiss, family dinner—all fragmented and corrupted.

**Secret:** Memory Phantoms are not hostile by nature—they're desperate. They attack because they perceive living beings as thieves (their memories are trapped in Memory Core, they want them back). If memory is restored successfully, Phantoms dissipate peacefully (returning to rightful owners).

**Relationship to Rem:** Complicated. Phantoms are drawn to her because she's trying to restore memories, but they also see her as threat (she's manipulating the data that contains their essence).

### Faction Context

**Faction:** None (manifestations of corrupted data, not sapient entities)
**Role:** Environmental hazard, consequence of Cascade Failure, obstacle in "The Chorus"
**Loyalty Level:** N/A (not truly alive, just echoes)
**Betrayal Condition:** N/A (cannot betray, has no allegiance)

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Manifest from shattered/corrupted memory jar, immediate Psychic Wail
**Strategy:**
- Drawn to Rem (must move toward her, attack her, disrupt her work)
- Attacks anyone who damaged its jar (vengeance)
- Uses Intangible Movement to pass through walls, reach Rem directly
- Prioritizes Memory Drain on technical specialists (steal skills needed to complete restoration)
- **Avoidance:** Flees from holy symbols, bright light (painful to corruption)
**Dissipation Condition:** Reduced to 0 HP OR memory jar is successfully re-stabilized (player uses "soothe memory" action) OR memory restoration completes successfully (Phantom returns to rightful owner)
**Backup Called:** None (solitary manifestations)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Nothing (not sapient, just echoes of lost memories)

**Clues It Provides:**
- **Indirect:** Seeing Phantom's flickering images reveals whose memory it is (birthday hat reads "Happy 8th Birthday, Sarah", wedding photo shows young couple, etc.)
- **Emotional:** Empathic players (DC 13 Insight) can sense Phantom's desperation and confusion (reveals they're victims, not villains)

### Special Notes

**Soothing Memory Phantoms (Non-Combat Resolution):**
- **Method Actor Action:** Charisma (Persuasion) check DC 13
- **Success:** Phantom calms, stops attacking, hovers peacefully (dissipates if memory restored)
- **Failure:** Phantom shatters jar it came from, increasing Cascade Failure +5%

**Visual Description Templates:**
Use these to personalize each Phantom:
1. **Child's Birthday:** Translucent form shows 8-year-old girl in party hat, blowing out candles, surrounded by smiling family—then static
2. **Graduation:** Young man in cap and gown, holding diploma, proud expression—flickers to despair
3. **Wedding Day:** Bride and groom's first kiss, confetti falling—corrupts to screaming
4. **Family Dinner:** Large family around table, laughing, passing food—fragments to loneliness

**Cascade Failure Relationship:**
- 1 Phantom manifests per failed "soothe memory" check
- Maximum 3 Phantoms can exist simultaneously (Memory Core can't sustain more)
- If 4th would manifest, oldest Phantom dissipates automatically

**Destroying vs. Soothing:**
- **Destroying** (reducing to 0 HP): Memory permanently lost, contributes to Cascade Failure +5%
- **Soothing** (successful Persuasion check): Memory preserved, contributes to Cascade Failure -5%

**Peaceful Dissipation (If Chorus Succeeds):**
If "The Chorus" climax succeeds with low Cascade Failure, describe:
- All Phantoms pause mid-attack
- Flickering images stabilize (clear birthday party, perfect graduation photo, joyful wedding)
- Phantoms smile (first time they've shown anything but anguish)
- Dissipate into motes of light that flow toward Memory Core
- **Narration:** *"The screaming stops. For the first time, the Phantoms look at peace. They're going home."*

**Armor:** Damaged porcelain shell with visible circuitry
**Hit Dice:** 3d8+3
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 8 (-1) |

**Skills:** Stealth +3
**Saves:** None
**Damage Resistances:** Psychic (experienced trauma, somewhat numb to it)
**Damage Vulnerabilities:** Fire (Kiln trauma)
**Senses:** Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 10
**Languages:** Common (broken, fragmented speech)

### Combat Actions

**Slam** | +3 to hit | 1d6+1 bludgeoning | 5ft reach
*Attacks with fists or improvised weapons (broken furniture, rocks, etc.).*

**Pack Tactics** | Passive
*Has advantage on attack rolls if at least one allied Glitched is within 5ft of target.*

**Desperate Fury** | Passive
*When reduced to half HP or below, gains +2 to damage rolls (desperation fuels violence).*

**Self-Destruct** | Action (requires HP < 5) | 10ft radius
*Glitched Lulu overloads its core, exploding in shower of porcelain shards and psychic energy. All creatures in radius make DC 12 Dexterity save or take 2d6 piercing + 1d6 psychic damage. Glitched Lulu is destroyed.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Survive. Follow Heartbreak's lead. Destroy Architects. Feel anything other than pain and confusion.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Broken speech patterns. "We... hurt... they made us... we make them..." Twitchy movements, sudden starts. Eyes flicker different colors (red/green/blue—confused programming). Some cry. Some laugh inappropriately. All are traumatized.

**Secret:** Each Glitched Lulu has fragments of memories from the person whose emotions fueled its creation. They experience flashbacks they don't understand (birthdays they never had, families they never knew).

**Relationship to Heartbreak:** Worship mixed with fear. Heartbreak is their prophet—only one who understands their suffering. Will die for Heartbreak without hesitation.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Glitched (rank-and-file members)
**Role:** Soldiers, protesters, victims seeking liberation through destruction
**Loyalty Level:** 8/10 (fanatically loyal to Heartbreak, willing to die for cause)
**Betrayal Condition:** If shown genuine empathy AND proof of non-violent liberation path (DC 18 Persuasion + evidence). Some might defect, most won't.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Swarm tactics—surround single target
**Strategy:**
- Fight in groups (use Pack Tactics)
- Protect Heartbreak, Rage, and Spite (interpose if needed)
- Use environment (throw objects, create hazards)
- Suicidal determination (will use Self-Destruct if losing badly)
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 5 and no chance of winning. May Self-Destruct instead of retreating.
**Backup Called:** Other Glitched in area (screaming/alarms summon 1d4 more in 3 rounds)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Glitched hideout locations - Revealed if: Captured and shown kindness (DC 14 Persuasion)
- Heartbreak's philosophy and goals - Revealed if: Asked (will proselytize eagerly)
- Locations of other Lulus that might be "awakened" - Revealed if: Trusted

**Clues They Can Provide:**
- Kiln location and access routes - Via interrogation or alliance
- Architect patrol patterns - Via observation sharing
- Which Lulus are "close to awakening" (sensing kin) - Via discussion

### Special Notes

**Individual Personalities:**
Despite similar stats, each Glitched Lulu should have personality quirk:
- **"Crackle":** Speech filled with static, twitches constantly
- **"Weeper":** Cries constantly, attacks while sobbing
- **"Giggler":** Laughs inappropriately, finds violence funny (trauma response)
- **"Quiet One":** Never speaks, communicates via gestures, deeply sad

**Memory Fragments:**
Each Glitched might experience random flashback during combat:
- Freezes for 1 round, mutters: "Mom? Where's... Mom?"
- Stares at own hands: "I remember... baking cookies? No... that wasn't me..."
- Confused: "Why am I fighting? I was... I was happy once..."

**Empathy Opportunity:**
Players who show genuine kindness to captured/injured Glitched may:
- Gain information (as per Revelations above)
- Convert Glitched to neutral (stops fighting, escapes)
- Plant seeds of doubt in Heartbreak's philosophy (narrative consequence)

**Self-Destruct Aftermath:**
- Creates 10ft radius difficult terrain (porcelain shards)
- Leaves behind cracked core (can be salvaged for Glitched Lulu Core item)
- Other Glitched who witness it become enraged (+2 to attacks for 1 minute)

## The Auditor (Infernal Observer - Boss-Tier Threat)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 18 (infernal resilience) | | HP   | 150 (12d10+84) |
| Speed| 40ft, fly 60ft | | Init | +4    |

**Armor:** Supernatural resistance (infernal contract manifestation)
**Hit Dice:** 12d10+84
**Proficiency Bonus:** +5

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 20 (+5) | 18 (+4) | 24 (+7) | 22 (+6) | 20 (+5) | 24 (+7) |

**Skills:** Perception +10, Insight +10, Intimidation +12, Deception +12
**Saves:** Str +10, Con +12, Int +11, Wis +10, Cha +12
**Damage Resistances:** Cold, Lightning; Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing from non-magical attacks
**Damage Immunities:** Fire, Poison
**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Exhausted, Frightened, Poisoned
**Senses:** Truesight 120ft, Passive Perception 20 (sees all, cannot be hidden from)
**Languages:** All, telepathy 120ft

### Combat Actions

**Multiattack** | 3 attacks per round (any combination)

**Brass Claw** | +10 to hit | 2d10+5 slashing + 1d10 fire | 10ft reach
*Superheated brass claws, impossibly sharp.*

**Infernal Gaze** | +12 to hit | 3d8 fire + 2d8 psychic | 60ft range
*The Auditor's eyes project molten brass judgment, burning body and mind.*

**Mark of Xaphan** | Action | DC 18 Charisma save
*Target within 60ft must save or be Marked (invisible brand). While Marked: Xaphan always knows target's location, target has disadvantage on saves against infernal magic, Xaphan can scry on target at will. Mark lasts until removed with *Remove Curse* (9th level) or Xaphan releases it.*

**Infernal Suggestion** | Action | DC 18 Wisdom save
*Target within 120ft must save or be Charmed for 8 hours. While Charmed, target follows Auditor's reasonable requests (as per *Suggestion* spell but more powerful). Target rationalizes obeying ("This makes sense," "I wanted to do this anyway").*

**Hellfire Eruption** | Action (Recharge 5-6) | 20ft radius, 60ft range
*Designates point within 60ft. Green hellfire erupts in 20ft radius. All creatures in area make DC 18 Dexterity save or take 6d6 fire + 3d6 psychic damage (half on success). Area becomes difficult terrain (burning) for 1 minute.*

**Contract Enforcement** | Legendary Action (3/round)
*The Auditor can take 3 legendary actions per round (only one at a time, only at end of another creature's turn):*
- **Move:** Fly up to half speed
- **Detect:** Make Perception check to locate hidden creature
- **Claw Attack:** Make one Brass Claw attack
- **Impose Dread (2 actions):** One creature within 60ft makes DC 18 Wisdom save or be Frightened for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of each turn)

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Observe Inkwell operation for Xaphan. Ensure contract terms are fulfilled. Report deviations. Punish those who interfere with diabolic interests.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Deep, resonant, patient. Speaks like lawyer reading contract terms. Never rushed. Every word precisely chosen. Eyes (molten brass) never blink. Smiles rarely—when it does, it's terrifying (predator recognizing prey).

**Secret:** The Auditor is manifestation of Brass Contract itself—Xaphan's will given form. Destroying it does NOT void contract, only delays Xaphan's awareness of breaches. Contract must be destroyed separately to break pact.

**Relationship to Ms. Reed:** Master to servant. Auditor sees Reed as tool (useful but expendable). Reed is terrified of Auditor (knows it reports her failures to Xaphan). Auditor's presence triggers panic attacks in Reed.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Architects (technically), but truly serves Xaphan (infernal entity)
**Role:** Observer, enforcer, Xaphan's eyes and hands in mortal realm
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 (absolute loyalty to Xaphan, cannot be swayed)
**Betrayal Condition:** Impossible. The Auditor IS the contract enforcement mechanism.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Observe (uses Detect legendary action) before attacking—gathers information first
**Strategy:**
- **Prioritization:** Targets those disrupting contract terms (memory theft interrupters, Brass Contract thieves)
- **Psychological Warfare:** Uses Infernal Suggestion to turn players against each other
- **Marking Threats:** Uses Mark of Xaphan on most dangerous enemy (tracks them permanently)
- **Area Denial:** Hellfire Eruption to control battlefield
- **Patient Destruction:** Doesn't rush—inevitable, not aggressive
- **Protect Contract:** Interposes if players approach physical Brass Contract
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 50. Retreats to Hell to regenerate, reports breach to Xaphan (returns in 1d4 days with reinforcements).
**Backup Called:** Can summon 2d4 imps (lesser devils) as bonus action (1/day)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Everything in facility (Xaphan's contract includes surveillance clause)
- Brass Contract full terms - Revealed if: Defeated and interrogated with *Zone of Truth* (still lies creatively)
- Xaphan's plans for Inkwell - Revealed if: Forced via powerful magic (*Dominate Monster* DC 20+)
- Ms. Reed's personal sacrifices - Revealed if: Taunting players ("She gave her daughter's memory willingly. Impressive dedication.")

**Clues It Provides:**
- Contract loopholes (if questioned creatively via legal argument) - Auditor respects clever legal maneuvering, might hint at escape clauses
- Xaphan's weaknesses - Will NEVER reveal voluntarily, only under extreme magical compulsion
- Infernal hierarchy information - Might boast about Xaphan's power/status (useful intel)

### Special Notes

**Atmospheric Presence (Not Combat Encounter):**
The Auditor should appear throughout adventure as atmospheric horror, NOT as combat enemy until climax (if at all):
- **Round 1:** Shadow in reflection (too tall, horned silhouette)
- **Round 3:** Temperature drops, smell of sulfur
- **Round 5:** Glimpse in peripheral vision (tall figure in brass suit, curved horns, molten eyes)
- **Round 7+:** Full manifestation (appears physically, speaks)

**When The Auditor Manifests:**
- All candles/flames turn green
- Temperature drops 20°F
- Shadows become unnaturally long, point toward Auditor
- Nearby electronic devices glitch (show Xaphan's symbol: burning contract)

**The Auditor's Deal:**
If players are losing badly, Auditor might offer deal:
- *"You've interfered with property of Xaphan, Duke of Greed. This violation demands... compensation. I offer you choice: Sign contract (become Xaphan's agents for 7 years) OR face destruction. You have 10 seconds."*
- **If players sign:** Becomes epilogue plot hook (must serve Xaphan or face infernal consequences)
- **If players refuse:** Combat continues

**Destroying The Auditor:**
- Reduced to 0 HP, does NOT die—dissipates
- Final words: *"Contract remains. Xaphan is patient. You've merely delayed inevitable."*
- Body dissolves into smoke and embers (leaves no loot)
- **Consequence:** Xaphan knows players' faces, sends bounty hunters (future plot hook)
- **Brass Scale Trophy:** DC 20 Thieves' Tools to pry one scale from dissipating body (proof of encounter, valuable 5,000cr)

**Contract Loopholes (If Players Ask Right Questions):**
The Auditor is bound by contract law—if players ask specifically about loopholes:
- *"Contract duration is perpetual... unless signatory ceases corporate existence."* (Hint: Destroying Inkwell Innovations voids contract)
- *"Xaphan receives Essentia Tithe per terms... unless source is destroyed."* (Hint: Destroy Memory Core/Kiln to break pact)
- *"Contract binds flesh and blood... but not if flesh belongs to another."* (Cryptic hint about possession/redemption?)

**Roleplaying The Auditor:**
- Speaks like bored accountant reviewing spreadsheets

**Skills:** None

**Condition Immunities:** Frightened (doesn't understand fear), Charmed (no mind to charm)
**Senses:** Blindsight 30ft (sense movement only), Passive Perception 8
**Languages:** None (moans, screams, no coherent speech)

### Combat Actions

**Feeble Grasp** | +1 to hit | 1d4-1 bludgeoning | 5ft reach
*Weak, grasping hand. Barely an attack, more plea for help.*

**Psychic Scream** | Passive
*Any creature that starts turn within 10ft of Corrupted Lulu must make DC 10 Wisdom save or be Disturbed (disadvantage on next attack roll—distraction from horror, not mechanical fear).*

**Death Throes** | Triggered on death
*When reduced to 0 HP, releases wave of psychic anguish. All within 15ft make DC 11 Wisdom save or take 1d6 psychic damage. Players experience flash of victim's final moments—confusion, pain, incompleteness.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** None (no sapience). Writhes in confusion and pain. Reaches for anything nearby (not attack, seeking help that cannot come).

**Voice/Mannerism:** Moans. Wet, rasping sounds. Half-formed mouth tries to speak, can't form words. Eyes (if it has them) beg for death. Crawls slowly, drags incomplete body, leaves trail of porcelain dust and psychic residue.

**Secret:** Corrupted Lulus are manufacturing failures—bodies pulled from Kiln too early, memories installed in incomplete vessels. They're trapped in permanent suffering, unable to live or die properly.

**Relationship to Glitched:** Glitched see Corrupted Lulus as "mercy cases"—they mercy-kill them on sight (putting them out of misery). Heartbreak calls them "the unfinished" with rare pity.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** None (not truly alive)
**Role:** Environmental hazard, horror element, evidence of Inkwell's cruelty
**Loyalty Level:** N/A
**Betrayal Condition:** N/A

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** None (does not initiate combat)
**Strategy:** No strategy (minimal sapience). Grasps at anything nearby—not trying to harm, trying to connect, to understand, to *be*.
**Retreat Condition:** Does not retreat (doesn't understand danger)
**Backup Called:** None (cannot call for help)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:** Nothing (no mind to hold information)

**Clues It Provides:**
- **Indirect Evidence:** Proves manufacturing process is deeply flawed and cruel
- **Emotional Impact:** Seeing Corrupted Lulu should horrify players, motivate them to shut down Kiln
- **Mercy Kill:** Killing one grants no XP but may provide moral weight

### Special Notes

**Mercy Killing:**
- Players can mercy-kill Corrupted Lulu with single attack (don't track HP—narratively dies quickly)
- **No XP reward** (not a combat encounter, an act of mercy)
- **Moral Weight:** Character who mercy-kills should roleplay emotional impact (killed suffering creature, prevented more suffering)

**Locations Found:**
- Legacy Asset Containment (sealed tomb of failures)
- The Kiln (manufacturing floor, half-formed bodies on conveyor belts)
- Sub-archive (stored as "evidence of process flaws" in sealed containers)

**Description Templates:**
1. **Half-Melted:** Body is liquid porcelain from waist down, face sliding off skull, reaching upward
2. **Incomplete Form:** Torso and one arm only, dragging itself in circles, moaning
3. **Multiple Heads:** Manufacturing error—two faces on one body, both crying different tears
4. **Exposed Circuitry:** Skin missing, wires and gears visible, sparking, whimpering in static

**Heartbreak's Reaction:**
If Heartbreak sees Corrupted Lulu, stops whatever they're doing, approaches, kneels, whispers:
*"Rest now. You were never meant to exist like this."* Then crushes its core (instant death, mercy).
Shows Heartbreak has capacity for compassion (only for those suffering like they did).

**Player Impact:**
Corrupted Lulus should invoke horror and pity, NOT combat challenge. Use sparingly—1-2 per adventure, for emotional beats, not encounters.

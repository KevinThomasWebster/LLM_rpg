### Combat Actions

**Multiattack** | 2 attacks per round
*The Warden makes two Slam attacks or one Slam and one Restraint Protocol.*

**Reinforced Slam** | +8 to hit | 2d8+4 bludgeoning | 5ft reach
*Heavy porcelain fist powered by hydraulic servos. Critical on 19-20.*

**Restraint Protocol** | +8 to hit | Grapple (escape DC 16) | 5ft reach
*Target is Grappled and Restrained. While grappling, The Warden can drag target at half speed.*

**Lockdown Command** | Action (1/day) | Special
*Activates facility-wide lockdown. All pneumatic tubes seal, doors lock (DC 18 Thieves' Tools to bypass), emergency lights activate. Lasts 10 minutes or until deactivated.*

**Security Alert** | Bonus Action
*Summons 2d4 Security Lulus to current location within 3 rounds.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Maintain order in Chimera Wing. Suppress disruption. Protect Architect authority.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Silent. Communicates via synthesized alarm tones and digital displays on chest panel (red = threat detected, yellow = warning, green = compliant). Movements are methodical, inevitable, machine-precise. The Warden doesn't rush—it *advances*.

**Secret:** The Warden contains fragments of the first Lulu prototype's AI. Deep in its code, a ghost of sentience watches, unable to act.

**Relationship to Ms. Reed:** Absolute obedience. Will sacrifice itself to protect her if necessary.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Architects (chief enforcer)
**Role:** Head of automated security, Ms. Reed's enforcer
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 (cannot disobey—hardcoded loyalty protocols)
**Betrayal Condition:** Impossible. Can only be hacked/reprogrammed (DC 22 Technology, requires 3 consecutive successful checks over 3 rounds while not in combat).

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Assess threats (1 round of observation), then engage highest threat level target
**Strategy:**
- Grapple spellcasters/technical specialists first (neutralize high-value targets)
- Use Restraint Protocol to drag captives toward holding cells
- Position body between threats and Ms. Reed if she's present
- Call backup via Security Alert if outnumbered (2+ enemies)
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 20. Retreats only to protect Ms. Reed or preserve facility integrity.
**Backup Called:** Security Lulus (continuous reinforcements until defeated), facility lockdown if desperate

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Full facility layout (networked database) - Revealed if: Hacked successfully
- All security protocols and override codes - Revealed if: Memory core accessed via hack
- Ms. Reed's daily schedule - Revealed if: Accessed via chest panel display (DC 16 Technology)
- Location of all detained personnel - Revealed if: Hacked

**Clues It Can Provide:**
- Security camera footage (stored internally for 72 hours) - Via successful hack
- Location of Sub-archive holding Brass Contract - Via internal map database
- Ms. Reed's emergency escape routes - Via security protocol files

### Special Notes

**Hacking The Warden:**
- Requires 3 consecutive DC 22 Technology checks (1 per round)
- Cannot be hacked while in combat (attacking or being attacked)
- If hacked: Can reprogram to ignore specific targets, provide security codes, or shut down for 1 hour
- **Risk:** Failed hack (3 failures total) triggers permanent lockdown and summons all available Security Lulus

**Destroying The Warden:**
- Upon defeat, chest panel displays: "ORDER... MAINTAINED... PROTOCOL... COMPLETE..."
- Body remains networked for 10 minutes (can still trigger alarms if tampered with)
- Contains valuable security override chip (can be extracted with DC 14 Thieves' Tools, provides advantage on future security bypasses)

## Alex Chen (Corporate Lawyer - Conflicted)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 11 (suit) | | HP   | 16 (3d8+3) |
| Speed| 30ft  | | Init | +0    |

**Armor:** Business suit
**Hit Dice:** 3d8+3
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 10 (+0) | 10 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 16 (+3) |

**Skills:** Persuasion +5, Deception +5, Insight +4, Investigation +5
**Saves:** None notable
**Senses:** Passive Perception 12
**Languages:** Common

### Combat Actions

**Improvised Weapon** | +0 to hit | 1d4 bludgeoning | 5ft
*Briefcase, tablet, etc. Alex is not a combatant and will avoid violence.*

**Legal Intimidation** | Action | DC 13 Charisma save
*Target within 30ft must save or be Frightened until end of Alex's next turn (threatened with litigation, NDA violations, corporate consequences).*

**Panic Button** | Bonus Action
*Press hidden panic button on tablet. Security Lulus arrive in 2 rounds. Alex rarely uses this—fears drawing Ms. Reed's attention to himself.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Atone for complicity in memory theft while avoiding Re-calibration. Desperately wants to help victims but is paralyzed by fear.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Nervous, uses corporate jargon compulsively when stressed ("Synergy alignment," "Paradigm leveraging"). Constantly adjusts tie, checks tablet obsessively, sweats visibly. When genuine emotion breaks through the corporate-speak, his voice cracks.

**Secret:** He has a young daughter outside the facility. His complicity haunts him because he keeps imagining her in the victims' place. The email from Margaret Torres (David's mother) was his breaking point.

**Relationship to Socket:** Friendship built on shared resentment of Inkwell, but Alex is far more risk-averse. Socket mocks him gently but respects his legal expertise.

### Faction Context

**Faction:** Internal Auditors (reluctant member, conflicted)
**Role:** Legal counsel, potential whistleblower
**Loyalty Level:** 5/10 (wants to help but terrified of consequences)
**Betrayal Condition:** If offered genuine protection OR Re-calibration becomes imminent threat (choose lesser evil). Can also betray players if he believes they're corporate spies testing him.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Flee or surrender immediately
**Strategy:** Alex is a coward in physical confrontation. He uses Legal Intimidation only if cornered and desperate. Otherwise, he runs or begs for mercy.
**Retreat Condition:** Any violence or threat. HP < 10 or any damage taken triggers immediate surrender.
**Backup Called:** Rarely calls security (fears Ms. Reed's attention), only if believes he's about to die

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Off-Site Data Archive location and access requirements - Revealed if: Trust established (DC 13 Persuasion) or threatened (DC 14 Intimidation)
- Physical Brass Contract location (Sub-archive) - Revealed if: Players commit to exposing Inkwell
- Socket's role and Workshop location - Revealed if: Players prove competence
- NDA and IP clause legal loopholes - Revealed if: Players ask legal questions
- Ms. Reed's personal memory sacrifice (Lily) - Revealed if: Players mention Special Commission Lulus
- Re-calibration process details - Revealed if: Discussing his fears

**Clues He Can Provide:**
- Socket authentication code: "Paradigm Shift" - Given if allied
- Board of Directors anonymous upload system - Given if allied
- Ms. Reed's daily schedule (knows when she'll be in office) - Given if asked
- Victim roster (names, dates, legal status) - Via his tablet if stolen or given

### Special Notes

**Alex's Tablet:**
- Contains emails from Socket (Workshop location)
- Margaret Torres email (emotional appeal content)
- Draft resignation letter (never sent—too afraid)
- Legal brief on memory IP rights (proves knowledge of theft)
- Board contact info (anonymous upload system)

**If Players Steal Tablet:**
- DC 16 Sleight of Hand during panic/distraction
- Contains most information Alex would reveal, but loses Alex as ally
- Alex reports theft immediately if not allied (security called)

**Re-calibration Arc:**
- If Alex is captured by Architects during encounter, he's sent for Re-calibration
- Can reappear later as mind-wiped, docile Architect loyalist (tragic encounter)
- Players might rescue him mid-transport (chase/heist scenario)

**Redemption Moment:**
- If players successfully ally with Alex, he gains courage throughout adventure
- Final scene (epilogue): Alex testifies against Inkwell at board hearing, citing daughter as reason for finding courage
- Rewards players with pro bono legal defense if they need it (permanent contact)

## Security Lulu (Standard Unit)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 13 (composite plating) | | HP   | 22 (4d8+4) |
| Speed| 30ft  | | Init | +1    |

**Armor:** Light porcelain-polymer composite
**Hit Dice:** 4d8+4
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 12 (+1) | 8 (-1) | 10 (+0) | 6 (-2) |

**Skills:** Perception +2
**Saves:** None
**Damage Resistances:** Poison
**Damage Vulnerabilities:** Radiant (holy water deals 1d6 radiant + DC 12 Con save or Frightened 1 round)
**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Frightened
**Senses:** Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 12, Networked Communication (shares sensory data with all Security Lulus within 100ft)
**Languages:** Common (understands, limited speech)

**Holy Water Vulnerability:** When hit by holy water, Security Lulu takes 1d6 radiant damage. Porcelain cracks and hisses, steam rises, and it must make DC 12 Constitution save or be Frightened (1 round). It recoils from the source.

### Combat Actions

**Stun Baton** | +4 to hit | 1d6+2 bludgeoning | 5ft reach
*Non-lethal. Target must make DC 12 Constitution save or be Stunned until end of next turn.*

**Restraint Protocol** | +4 to hit | Grapple (escape DC 13) | 5ft reach
*Target is Grappled. Security Lulu can drag grappled target at half speed toward holding cells.*

**Alert Network** | Bonus Action
*Shares combat data with all Security Lulus within 100ft. All networked Lulus gain advantage on next attack against alerted target.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Maintain order. Suppress disruption. Use minimum force necessary (programmed for non-lethal compliance).

**Voice/Mannerism:** Monotone, limited vocabulary. Phrases like "Compliance required," "Synergy violation detected," "Resistance will result in corrective measures." Movements are stiff, robotic. No personality—pure function.

**Secret:** These units have no sentience. They're sophisticated automatons without the spark that makes Glitched "alive." But if exposed to "The Scream" (Glitched broadcast), they might awaken...

**Relationship to Glitched:** Glitched see Security Lulus as "potential blanks" (empty vessels that could be awakened) or "slave enforcers" (traitors to their own kind, though they lack capacity to choose).

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Architects (automated enforcement)
**Role:** Security patrol, threat response, prisoner transport
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 (cannot disobey—programmed loyalty)
**Betrayal Condition:** Cannot betray. Can only be hacked (DC 16 Technology, 1 round) or awakened by Glitched broadcast.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Assess threat, announce violation: "Synergy violation detected. Compliance required."
**Strategy:**
- Prioritize non-lethal restraint (Stun Baton to disable, Restraint Protocol to capture)
- Work in coordinated pairs (use Alert Network for advantage)
- Transport prisoners to holding cells (won't kill unless explicitly overridden by Warden/Reed)
- Call reinforcements if outnumbered (1d4 more Security Lulus arrive in 2 rounds)
**Retreat Condition:** HP < 5, retreats to nearest Security Station to self-repair
**Backup Called:** The Warden (if 3+ Security Lulus destroyed in one encounter), more Security Lulus (continuous response)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Facility layout (networked maps) - Revealed if: Hacked
- Current security alert level - Revealed if: Hacked
- Last known location of "priority targets" (if players are marked) - Revealed if: Hacked

**Clues They Can Provide:**
- Security patrol routes and schedules - Via hacking
- Location of holding cells - Via hacking
- Override codes for doors in their patrol zone - Via hacking

### Special Notes

**Hacking Security Lulus:**
- DC 16 Technology check, takes 1 action
- If successful: Can issue one command (ignore specific person for 1 hour, report false all-clear, provide patrol route, etc.)
- If failed: Lulu alerts network immediately, summons backup
- **Limitation:** Hacked Lulu reverts to normal programming after 1 hour or if given contradictory command

**Awakening via Glitched Broadcast:**
- If exposed to "The Scream" (Hijack the Signal encounter or Glitched ability), Security Lulu has 50% chance of awakening
- **Awakened State:** Stops following orders, confused, may join Glitched or flee
- **Provides:** Potential ally if players help newly awakened Lulu understand its situation (DC 14 Persuasion)

**Destroying Security Lulus:**
- Upon defeat, body sparks and goes inert
- **Veridian Echo:** If destroyed in certain locations (Kiln, Memory Core), releases psychic feedback (all within 30ft make DC 12 Wis save or take 1d6 psychic damage + brief vision of Hell)
- Body can be scavenged for parts:
  - **Stun Baton:** Can be removed and used as weapon (1d6+Str bludgeoning, DC 12 Con save or Stunned 1 round)
  - **Control Chip:** Can be used to hack other Security Lulus with advantage
  - **Processing Unit:** Valuable tech (500cr resale value)

**Variant: Security Lulu (Glitched Awakened)**
If awakened by broadcast, stats change:
- **HP:** Increases to 28 (gains determination)
- **INT:** Increases to 12 (sentience)
- **CHA:** Increases to 10 (personality)
- **New Ability - Confused Aggression:** Attacks indiscriminately until calmed (DC 14 Persuasion or Heartbreak's command)
- **Alignment Shift:** Becomes chaotic neutral (confused, angry, seeking purpose)

## The Watcher (Butler Lulu - Ms. Reed's Guardian)

### Quick Stats
| Stat | Value | | Stat | Value |
|------|-------|---|------|-------|
| AC   | 15 (reinforced porcelain) | | HP   | 30 (4d10+8) |
| Speed| 25ft  | | Init | +3    |

**Armor:** Formal butler attire over reinforced porcelain shell
**Hit Dice:** 4d10+8
**Proficiency Bonus:** +2

**Ability Scores:**
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 16 (+3) | 16 (+3) | 14 (+2) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 10 (+0) |

**Skills:** Perception +4, Stealth +5, Insight +4
**Saves:** Dex +5
**Damage Resistances:** Poison
**Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Frightened
**Senses:** Darkvision 60ft, Passive Perception 14, Synchronized with Ms. Reed's schedule (knows her location within facility)
**Languages:** Common (fluent, speaks rarely)

### Combat Actions

**Precise Strike** | +5 to hit | 1d8+3 bludgeoning or slashing | 5ft reach
*The Watcher uses concealed weaponry (retractable blade in wrist or reinforced fist). Damage type varies.*

**Interpose** | Reaction
*When Ms. Reed is targeted by attack within 5ft, The Watcher interposes. Attack targets The Watcher instead. Ms. Reed gains half-cover (+2 AC, +2 Dex saves).*

**Purge Protocol** | Action (1/day)
*Wipes targeted electronic device within 10ft. DC 18 Technology save or device is permanently erased (all data lost). Primary use: wiping Ms. Reed's terminal if infiltrated.*

**Silent Alarm** | Bonus Action
*Activates silent alarm. Ms. Reed is notified immediately. Security Lulus arrive in 3 rounds.*

### Roleplay Guide

**Motivation:** Protect Ms. Reed. Preserve her secrets. Execute protocols with perfect precision.

**Voice/Mannerism:** Rarely speaks. When it does, voice is cultured, British-butler accent, emotionless. Movements are eerily graceful—glides rather than walks. Face is expressionless white mask. The Watcher is always watching, always calculating.

**Secret:** The Watcher contains Ms. Reed's first memory sacrifice (memory of her wedding day). It doesn't know this, but players who touch it might experience faint psychic echo—a bride in white, holding hands with shadowy figure, feeling of profound loss.

**Relationship to Ms. Reed:** Absolute devotion. Will sacrifice itself without hesitation if it protects her. Its programming includes: "Ms. Reed's survival is primary objective. All other considerations are secondary."

### Faction Context

**Faction:** The Architects (Ms. Reed's personal guardian)
**Role:** Bodyguard, data protection, executive assistant
**Loyalty Level:** 10/10 (hardcoded devotion, cannot be reprogrammed)
**Betrayal Condition:** Impossible. Even hacking cannot override Reed protection protocols.

### Combat Tactics

**Opening Move:** Position between Ms. Reed and threat, assess danger level
**Strategy:**
- **Defensive:** Uses Interpose every round if Ms. Reed threatened
- **Offensive:** Only attacks if Ms. Reed orders it OR threat bypasses it to reach her
- **Data Protection:** Uses Purge Protocol immediately if terminal infiltration detected
- **Support:** Activates Silent Alarm if outnumbered, provides tactical data to Ms. Reed (enemy positions, weaknesses observed)
**Retreat Condition:** Only retreats if Ms. Reed retreats. HP < 10 and Ms. Reed safe = power down
**Backup Called:** Security Lulus (via Silent Alarm), The Warden (if Ms. Reed's life threatened)

### Revelations & Secrets

**Knows About:**
- Ms. Reed's full schedule and habits - Revealed if: Destroyed and memory core scavenged (DC 16 Technology)
- Terminal access codes (temporary) - Revealed if: Hacked impossibly (DC 22 Technology)
- Ms. Reed's personal safes and hidden compartments - Revealed if: Defeated and interrogated via captured AI core

**Clues It Can Provide:**
- Ms. Reed's current location (within facility) - Via hacking
- Terminal purge countdown timer - Visible on chest panel LED
- Ms. Reed's psychological state (monitors her stress levels) - Via captured AI analysis

### Special Notes

**The Watcher's Special Relationship with Ms. Reed:**
- The Watcher is NOT just a bodyguard—it's a repository for Reed's first memory sacrifice
- If players destroy it, Reed suffers psychic feedback (takes 2d6 psychic damage, DC 14 Wis save or Stunned 1 round)
- Reed will mourn its destruction: "You killed... you killed the day I was happiest..." (cryptic, reveals emotional connection)

**Psychic Echo (if touched/destroyed):**
- DC 13 Wisdom save when touching The Watcher
- **If failed:** Brief vision—wedding chapel, bride in white (younger Ms. Reed), holding hands with faceless groom, overwhelming love and hope, then static and loss
- **Revelation:** Players realize Reed sacrificed her happiest memory—her wedding day

**Terminal Purge Countdown:**
- In "Sanctum Sanctorum" encounter, The Watcher's chest panel displays countdown timer in red LED (10:00 minutes)
- Counts down visibly (9:59... 9:58...) creating tension
- At 0:00, executes Purge Protocol automatically

**Hacking Impossibility:**
- The Watcher cannot be hacked by normal means (DC 22+ Technology, even then only partial success)
- Reed's protection protocols are hardcoded at firmware level
- **Possible Exploit:** If players obtain Reed's personal override code from her office safe (DC 18 Thieves' Tools + knowing it exists), can shut down The Watcher for 1 hour

**Salvage After Defeat:**
- **Memory Core Fragment:** Contains wedding memory (psychic echo)
- **Protocol Chip:** Grants insight into Reed's security measures (advantage on future office infiltration)
- **Watcher's Blade:** Retractable wrist blade (1d8 slashing, concealable, requires attunement)

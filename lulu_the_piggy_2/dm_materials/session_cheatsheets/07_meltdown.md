# Meltdown - Quick Reference

## At a Glance
- **Location:** The Kiln (Arcane forge chamber)
- **Factions Present:** ðŸ¤– Glitched (forcing meltdown), ðŸ‘» Echoes (preventing meltdown), ðŸ“‹ Internal Auditors (exploiting chaos)
- **Key NPCs:** Rage (enforcer), Rem (desperate), Socket (remote support if allied)
- **Est. Duration:** 25-35 minutes (10-minute countdown = 100 rounds, but use narrative time)

## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"You descend into hell's industrial heart. Heat slams into you like a physical force. The air reeks of ozone, hot metal, and burnt sugar with a sulfurous undercurrent. The chamber bathes in pulsing red emergency strobesâ€”occasionally flaring with unnatural greenish hellfire. In the center, the Kiln itself glows dangerous cherry-red, vats of porcelain slurry bubbling violently. On the far wall, a massive digital timer projects in stark white: 9:47... 9:46... 9:45... The countdown to meltdown has begun. Alarms blare. At the control booth elevated above, you see Glitched sabotaging systems. Near the Kiln, Echoes desperately try to reach override controls. The room feels less industrial and more diabolicalâ€”a physical manifestation of the Brass Contract itself."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Players enter Kiln chamber with **meltdown countdown active**
- **Key Element:** **Three-way faction conflict** - Glitched vs. Echoes vs. Internal Auditors (players must choose)
- **Initial Countdown:** 10:00 minutes (narrative time, not 100 rounds)
- **Faction Positions:**
  - **Glitched (Rage + 2-3 Glitched Lulus):** At control booth, sabotaging coolant systems, defending access
  - **Echoes (Rem + Leo if alive):** On factory floor, trying to reach emergency shutdown lever (blocked by debris and Glitched)
  - **Internal Auditors (If Socket allied):** Socket remotely guides players via comm link to secondary terminal for data theft
- **Environmental Chaos:**
  - Heat: DC 12 Con save each 10 rounds or gain 1 level of exhaustion
  - Falling debris: Random 1d6 bludgeoning damage to random character each round (Dex save DC 13 negates)
  - Toxic fumes: Lightly obscured vision, DC 13 Con save or disadvantage on Perception

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-7)
- **Trigger:** Players must choose faction alliance OR pursue own goal
- **Key Element:** Each faction has different win conditionâ€”helping one hurts others
- **Path A - Help Glitched (Meltdown Succeeds):**
  - Goal: Ensure meltdown completes, destroy Memory Core data, achieve "Great Unraveling"
  - Actions Required:
    - Defend control booth from Echoes (combat or blockade)
    - Sabotage emergency shutdown lever (DC 15 Technology to permanently disable)
    - Delay Echoes for 10 minutes (combat, persuasion, or environmental traps)
  - **Ally Bonus:** If allied from "Audience with Heartbreak," Rage fights with players
  - **Consequence:** Memory Core data purged (Echoes lose all hope), facility severely damaged, Glitched "freed," infernal contract weakened
- **Path B - Help Echoes (Meltdown Prevented):**
  - Goal: Reach emergency shutdown, preserve Memory Core data, enable "The Chorus"
  - Actions Required:
    - Reach control booth and flip emergency shutdown (contested by Glitched)
    - OR repair coolant system (DC 16 Technology, 3 successes needed)
    - Protect Rem/Leo from Glitched attacks (combat)
  - **Ally Bonus:** If allied with Echoes, Rem knows fastest route to shutdown, Leo provides technical support
  - **Consequence:** Memory Core preserved (enables "The Chorus" climax), Kiln stabilized, Glitched plan failed, infernal contract intact
- **Path C - Help Internal Auditors (Steal Data During Chaos):**
  - Goal: Use meltdown chaos as cover to access secondary terminal for Essentia Tithe financial records
  - Actions Required:
    - Reach secondary terminal in control booth (must bypass or defeat Glitched)
    - Download financial records (takes 3 rounds while chaos rages)
    - Survive and escape with data (board evidence)
  - **Ally Bonus:** If Socket allied, he remotely unlocks terminal and guides players
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup evidence obtained (smoking gun), players don't directly influence meltdown outcome (decided by Glitched vs. Echoes)
- **Path D - Neutral/Sabotage All (Chaos):**
  - Goal: Disrupt all factions, escape during confusion
  - Actions: Attack all sides equally, steal valuables, flee
  - **Consequence:** No faction allies, all become hostile, unpredictable outcome

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 8-12)
- **Trigger:** Countdown reaches critical phase (5:00 minutes remaining) OR major faction conflict intensifies
- **Key Element:** Environmental hazards intensify, stakes become visceral
- **Environmental Escalation:**
  - Heat increases: DC 14 Con save or 2d6 fire damage per 10 rounds
  - Conveyor belt activates: Half-formed Lulu bodies moving through chamber (disturbing sight)
  - Porcelain vats boil over: Splashing molten porcelain (3d6 fire damage, Dex save DC 14 for half)
  - Hellfire flares: Green flames erupt from Kiln (psychic assault, DC 13 Wis save or Frightened 1 minute)
- **Faction Desperation:**
  - **Glitched (If losing):** Rage goes berserk, attacks indiscriminately to buy time
  - **Echoes (If losing):** Rem makes suicide run to shutdown lever, will sacrifice self
  - **Auditors (If present):** Socket warns data window closing, urges urgency
- **Veridian Echo Event (Critical Moment):**
  - If any Lulu is destroyed during combat, **all players** suffer psychic flash
  - **Vision:** Hellish forge in Nine Hells, green hellfire, brass machinery with infernal runes, demonic silhouettes, Xaphan's face grinning
  - **Effect:** DC 14 Wisdom save or Stunned for 1 round (psychic overload)
  - **Revelation:** Confirms Secret #2 (Brass Contract) and Secret #7 (Infernal Observer)â€”Kiln is literally connected to Hell

### Stage 4: The Climax (Final 3:00 minutes)
- **Resolution A - Meltdown Succeeds (Glitched Victory):**
  - Countdown reaches 0:00
  - Kiln explodes in dramatic but non-lethal eruption (players must flee, DC 15 Athletics)
  - Memory Core data purged completely
  - Facility structurally damaged (wing collapse imminent)
  - Glitched celebrate briefly, then realize cost (many died in explosion)
  - **Consequences:** "The Chorus" climax UNAVAILABLE, Glitched ending possible, infernal contract weakened but not broken, Inkwell Innovations will collapse
  - **Survivor Outcome:** Remaining Glitched flee, Echoes devastated, Internal Auditors may have evidence if players helped
- **Resolution B - Meltdown Prevented (Echoes Victory):**
  - Emergency shutdown activated OR coolant system repaired
  - Kiln enters safe shutdown mode (timer stops, heat begins dissipating)
  - Memory Core data preserved intact
  - Glitched furious, may attack in desperation or flee (depending on player relations)
  - **Consequences:** "The Chorus" climax AVAILABLE, Echoes can attempt memory restoration, infernal contract intact, Inkwell operations continue until exposed
  - **Survivor Outcome:** Echoes grateful, Glitched become enemies (if not already), facility stabilizes
- **Resolution C - Partial Outcomes (Mixed Results):**
  - **Shutdown Too Late:** Meltdown partially succeeds, some Memory Core data corrupted (50% loss)
  - **Shutdown Sabotaged After:** Glitched restart meltdown after Echoes shut down (requires second shutdown)
  - **All Factions Weakened:** Combat depletes all sides, meltdown outcome determined by environmental factors (DM decides based on what players prioritized)
- **Resolution D - Internal Auditor Success (Data Stolen):**
  - Players obtain Essentia Tithe financial records during chaos
  - **Files Contain:** Explicit payments from "Inkwell Innovations" to "Xaphan Ltd.," memory extraction quotas, soul-exchange rates
  - **Board of Directors Use:** Smoking gun evidence for Internal Coup ending

### Three-Way Faction Conflict Mechanics
This encounter is unique because **three factions have competing goals in the same space**. Managing this requires careful tracking:

**Faction Priorities:**
1. **Glitched:** Defend control booth, prevent shutdown, endure countdown
2. **Echoes:** Reach shutdown lever OR repair coolant, preserve data
3. **Internal Auditors:** Reach secondary terminal, download data (3 rounds), escape

**DM Tracking:**
- Round 1-3: Factions establish positions, initial conflict
- Round 4-7: Players choose side OR pursue own goal, faction combat intensifies
- Round 8-10: Desperation tactics, environmental hazards peak
- Round 11-12: Final push, resolution

**If Players Don't Choose:**
- Glitched and Echoes fight each other
- Outcome determined by dice rolls or environmental factors
- Players can still pursue Auditor goal (selfish but valid)

### The Meltdown Countdown
Use **narrative time**, not literal round-by-round countdown.

**Time Management:**
- Start encounter: "10:00 minutes remaining"
- After Stage 1 (3 rounds): "8:00 minutes"
- After Stage 2 (4 rounds): "5:00 minutes"
- After Stage 3 (4 rounds): "2:00 minutes"
- Final stage: Count down by 10-second increments for tension

**Adjust Timing to Player Actions:**
- If players work efficiently: Countdown slows (reward competence)
- If players waste time debating: Countdown accelerates (create urgency)

**Goal:** Create tension without arbitrary time pressure. The countdown is a storytelling tool, not a rigid mechanic.

### Veridian Echo Vision (Critical Moment)
When a Lulu is destroyed in combat, trigger this psychic vision for all players:

**Description:**
*"The moment the Lulu's porcelain shell shatters, reality fractures. You're no longer in the Kilnâ€”you're BEYOND it. A vast hellish forge stretches before you, its flames sickly green, not red. Brass machinery etched with squirming infernal runes pumps and churns. Demonic silhouettes work the furnace, their forms writhing and indistinct. And in the center, a faceâ€”brass mask, curved horns, eyes like molten goldâ€”turns toward you and SMILES. Then you're back. The Kiln. The heat. The countdown. But you KNOW: this place is connected to Hell itself."*

**Mechanical Effect:**
- DC 14 Wisdom save or Stunned for 1 round (psychic overload)
- Confirms infernal nature of operation
- Players now understand Brass Contract is literal diabolic pact

**Use Sparingly:** Trigger only once per encounter (first Lulu death) for maximum impact.

### Rage's Berserk State
If meltdown is being prevented (shutdown lever pulled or coolant repaired), Rage enters berserk mode:

**Berserk Behavior:**
- Attacks recklessly (advantage on attacks, attacks have advantage against him)
- Ignores self-preservation (stands in fire, takes environmental damage without dodging)
- Targets whoever interfered with meltdown (prioritizes shutdown-puller)
- **Final Act:** If defeated, Rage attempts to restart meltdown with dying action (Strength check to flip lever back, DC 18, usually fails)

**Roleplaying Rage:**
- Roars instead of speaks
- Pure violence and desperation
- Tragic figureâ€”dying for an ideal (freedom) they'll never experience

### Rem's Sacrifice Moment
If Echoes are losing and shutdown is unreachable, Rem makes desperate choice:

**The Sacrifice:**
Rem attempts to run through environmental hazards (molten porcelain, falling debris, hellfire) to reach shutdown lever.

**Mechanics:**
- 3 rounds to reach lever
- Each round: DC 15 Dexterity save or take 3d6 fire damage
- 80% chance of death even if successful
- **If successful:** Shutdown activated, Memory Core saved, Rem dies in players' arms

**Roleplaying Rem's Final Words:**
*"Tell them... tell the others... they were real. They mattered. Please... remember us."*

**Emotional Impact:** Devastating sacrifice, shows cost of faction conflict, makes "The Chorus" climax deeply personal.

### Internal Auditor Data Theft
If players pursue Socket's objective:

**Terminal Location:** Secondary console in control booth (must reach it)

**Download Process:**
- Round 1: Access terminal (automatic if Socket remotely unlocks)
- Round 2: Select files (financial records)
- Round 3: Download completes

**Files Obtained:**
- Essentia Tithe payment ledger (2010-2025)
- Soul quota tracking spreadsheets
- Emails between Ms. Reed and "X.Ltd" (Xaphan Ltd.)
- Memory-to-essence conversion rates

**Board of Directors Use:** This data is smoking gun for Internal Coup ending. Board cannot ignore literal evidence of soul trafficking.

**Moral Ambiguity:** Players can steal data WHILE factions kill each other for conflicting goals. Selfish but pragmatic.

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Rem shouts: "The shutdown lever! In the control booth!" (clear objective marker)
- Socket (if allied) texts: "Secondary terminal, northeast corner of booth. 3-minute window." (guides Auditor path)
- Rage roars challenge: "You want to save Empty Vessels' data? GO THROUGH ME!" (combat path to booth)
- Countdown timer flashes red at 5:00 mark (urgency escalation)
- Leo yells: "I can repair the coolant if someone protects me!" (alternative route)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might try to negotiate Glitched vs. Echoes truce (Heartbreak won't accept, but interesting attempt)
- Could attempt to partially preserve Memory Core while allowing meltdown (compromiseâ€”very difficult)
- May try to sabotage Kiln to break infernal contract without data loss (creative solution, reward if executed well)
- Might attempt to use meltdown as leverage against Ms. Reed (hostage situation)
- Could try to steal Brass Contract physical copy from sub-archive during chaos (if they know about it)

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: Narrative 10 minutes = ~12-15 meaningful exchanges**. This is the most complex encounter.

**Do not let players debate endlessly.** The countdown should create urgency:
- Round 1-3: Assess situation, choose faction
- Round 4-7: Execute plan, overcome obstacles
- Round 8-10: Final push, environmental hazards peak
- Round 11-12: Resolution, consequences

**Pacing Tools:**
- Describe countdown timer frequently: "7:23... 7:22... 7:21..."
- Increase environmental hazard frequency as time runs out
- NPC desperation escalates (Rem's sacrifice, Rage's berserk, Socket's warnings)

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **If Meltdown Succeeds:** "The Chorus" unavailable, Glitched ending possible, facility collapses (escape encounter)
- **If Meltdown Prevented:** "The Chorus" available, Echoes ending possible, Glitched become permanent enemies
- **If Data Stolen:** "The Upload" ending available, Internal Coup succeeds regardless of meltdown outcome
- **If Rem Dies:** "The Chorus" more difficult (Leo must lead, less competent)

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** Overwhelming sensory assault (heat, noise, chaos)
- **Investigation:** Recognition of impossible choice (all factions have valid goals)
- **Negotiation/Combat:** Desperation and violence (faction conflict at peak)
- **Climax:** Either tragic sacrifice (Rem) or pyrrhic victory (meltdown prevented but cost high) or selfish pragmatism (data theft)
- **Aftermath:** Consequences ripple into final climax, survivor guilt/triumph mixed

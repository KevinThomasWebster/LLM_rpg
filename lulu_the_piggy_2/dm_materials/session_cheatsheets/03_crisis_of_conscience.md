## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"You step onto a sterile glass walkway suspended between wings of the facility. Polished white marble floors create a disorienting hall-of-mirrors effect‚Äîinfinite reflections of yourself stretching in every direction. The air is still, temperature-controlled to exactly 72¬∞F, and smells of absolutely nothing. A man in a charcoal suit paces frantically, reviewing something on his tablet with trembling hands. His name tag reads 'Alex Chen, Legal Counsel.' He mutters to himself, occasionally glancing at security cameras with visible fear."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Players encounter Alex in visible distress
- **Key Element:** Alex reviewing email from distraught mother whose son was in the program
- **Alex's State:** Hands shaking, breathing erratic, clearly on edge of breakdown
- **If Players Observe:** DC 12 Insight reveals genuine moral crisis (not deception), DC 14 Insight reveals he's terrified of being caught
- **Alex's Timeline:**
  - Round 1: Muttering about "just doing his job" and "they signed the forms"
  - Round 2: Stares at camera, wipes sweat from forehead
  - Round 3: Panic escalating, if not approached he'll trigger security attention

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-7)
- **Trigger:** Players engage Alex OR his panic escalates
- **Key Element:** Alex wants to confess but is terrified of "Re-calibration" (mind-wiping)
- **Interaction Paths:**
  - **Empathy (Persuasion DC 13):** Connect emotionally, validate his guilt, offer partnership
  - **Pressure (Intimidation DC 14):** Threaten exposure unless he helps, leverage his fear
  - **Logic (Persuasion DC 15):** Present pragmatic argument that cooperation is his best option
  - **Bribery (Deception DC 16):** Promise protection/extraction (lie or genuine)
- **Alex's Defenses:**
  - Initially evasive, uses corporate jargon to deflect
  - Fears players are corporate spies testing loyalty
  - Needs proof players are genuinely trying to help victims
- **Complication:** Each failed social check increases Alex's panic meter by 1
  - Panic 3+: Alex becomes unreasonable, harder to convince (all DCs +2)
  - Panic 5+: Alex flees or security arrives (Round 7)

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 8-10)
- **Trigger:** Alex begins to trust players OR security is summoned
- **Path A - Trust Established:**
  - Alex reveals existence of **Off-Site Data Archive**
  - Mentions physical backup of **The Brass Contract** stored there
  - Explains he can't access it himself (needs Socket's help)
  - Provides Socket's location (Workshop) and authentication method
- **Path B - Failed Negotiation:**
  - Alex's panic reaches critical level
  - Security team arrives to escort "over-stressed employee" for "wellness check"
  - Players have 2 rounds to intervene or salvage situation
- **Security Arrival (if triggered):**
  - 2 Security Lulus arrive
  - Alex goes docile, corporate persona returns (fear overrides guilt)
  - Lulus attempt to escort Alex for "Re-calibration"
  - Players can fight, distract, or let him go

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 11-12)
- **Resolution A - Alliance Secured:** Alex becomes Internal Auditor ally
  - Provides Socket authentication code: "Paradigm Shift"
  - Gives tablet with encrypted files (emails mentioning Socket, Archive location)
  - Warns about Ms. Reed's fanaticism and The Auditor's surveillance
  - Promises to help players if they can expose the program to the board
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup path opened, Alex contact for future
- **Resolution B - Partial Success:** Alex escorted away but drops tablet
  - Players can pickpocket/steal tablet as Alex is led away (Sleight of Hand DC 16)
  - Tablet contains Socket mentions and Archive location (less complete info)
  - No future Alex contact, but Auditor path still accessible
  - **Consequence:** Harder Internal Coup path, less information
- **Resolution C - Complete Failure:** Alex taken for Re-calibration
  - No information gained
  - Internal Coup path much harder (must find Socket without authentication)
  - Alex returns later as mindwiped, loyal Architect (tragic encounter)
  - **Consequence:** One ending path severely damaged

## NPCs Present

### Alex Chen ([Faction: Internal Auditors - Conflicted])
- **Goal:** Atone for complicity while avoiding Re-calibration
- **Stat Block:** See NPC Cards #2 (AC 11, HP 16, non-combative)
- **Key Personality Traits:**
  - Corporate-speak when nervous (deflects with jargon)

  - Full extent of memory heist program
  - Location of Off-Site Data Archive

  - Socket's role as reluctant IT accomplice
  - Ms. Reed's fanaticism and personal sacrifices

  - His own guilt (struggles to sleep, has nightmares)
- **Proactive Timeline:**
  - Round 1-3: Internal crisis, muttering, pacing
  - Round 4-6: Engagement with players, testing their intentions
  - Round 7+: Decision point - ally with players OR panic escalates

## DM Notes

### Environmental Interactivity
- **Glass Walls:** Transparent, creates visibility issues (anyone can see conversation from distance)
- **Infinite Reflections:** Disorienting, can be used for Stealth (hide in visual noise)
- **Security Cameras:** 3 cameras monitoring bridge, Alex hyper-aware of their positions
- **Marble Floor:** Slippery when wet (could dump water bottles for escape route)
- **Pneumatic Tube Station:** Can send fake security alerts to distract
- **Emergency Exit:** Locked, requires keycard (Alex has one)

### Alex's Emotional State
This encounter is fundamentally about **reading and responding to a person in crisis**. Alex is not a puzzle to solve‚Äîhe's a human being on the edge of breakdown.

**Effective Approaches:**
- **Empathy:** Validate his feelings, don't minimize his guilt, offer partnership
  - *Example:* "You didn't know how far it would go. But you know now. Help us fix it."
- **Pragmatism:** Frame helping as safer than staying silent
  - *Example:* "If this program collapses, who do you think takes the fall? The lawyers. Help us, and you're a whistleblower, not a criminal."
- **Moral Authority:** Appeal to the victims directly
  - *Example:* "That mother whose email you're reading‚Äîtell me her son's name. Help us give him his memories back."

**Ineffective Approaches:**
- Threats of violence (he'll panic, security called)
- Dismissing his fear (he'll shut down)
- Corporate jargon without empathy (he'll retreat into defensive mode)
- Demanding too much too fast (he needs to be eased into betrayal)

### The Email (Optional Detail)
If players ask what Alex is reading, describe:

*The tablet displays an email from "Margaret Torres" dated three days ago. The subject line reads: "Please, where is my son?" The body describes a 19-year-old named David who joined the Young Creatives Program six months ago. His messages home became infrequent, then stopped. When Margaret visited, she was told he'd "left the program early due to creative differences." She knows he wouldn't leave without telling her. The email ends: "Mr. Chen, the NDA I signed can't make me forget my own child. Please, if you know anything, I'm begging you."*

This email is Alex's breaking point. Use it to anchor the moral stakes.

### Panic Meter Mechanic
Track Alex's panic level (0-5):
- **0-1:** Nervous but functional
- **2-3:** Sweating, stumbling over words, harder to convince
- **4:** Hyperventilating, considering fleeing
- **5:** Full breakdown, security called OR flees

**Increase Panic:** Failed social checks, mentioning Re-calibration, aggressive threats, delays
**Decrease Panic:** Successful Persuasion, showing empathy, offering concrete help, validating his guilt

### Socket Authentication Code
When Alex provides "Paradigm Shift," explain its significance:

*"Alex leans in, whispers: 'Socket doesn't trust anyone from corporate. When you find him, say 'Paradigm Shift.' It's an inside joke from when we had to rebrand the entire program after a legal scare. He'll know I sent you.'"*

This code opens "The Gatekeeper" encounter much more smoothly.

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Another employee passes by, Alex goes silent (shows his fear, hints at surveillance)
- Alex drops tablet, players see Margaret's email accidentally (emotional hook)
- Security camera rotates, Alex visibly relaxes when blind spot appears (shows surveillance)
- Alex makes cryptic comment: "I should talk to Socket about this... but I can't face him" (Socket mention)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might offer to physically extract Alex (he'll refuse‚Äîfamily outside facility)
- Could try to blackmail him (backfires‚Äîhe'll accept Re-calibration rather than enable more harm)
- May attempt to comfort him emotionally (roleplay opportunity, builds trust faster)
- Might ask about legal specifics of IP clause (Alex can explain memory rights transfer)
- Could offer to record confession (Alex refuses‚Äîtoo dangerous‚Äîbut appreciates gesture)

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: 8-12 meaningful exchanges**. This is a dialogue-heavy encounter.

Structure:
- Observation and approach (1-2 rounds)
- Initial contact and trust-building (2-3 rounds)
- Negotiation and convincing (3-4 rounds)
- Information exchange or consequences (2-3 rounds)

**Do not rush the trust-building phase.** Alex needs to believe players are:
1. Capable of helping (not just idealistic kids)
2. Genuinely trying to help victims (not corporate spies)
3. Able to protect him OR worth the risk of exposure

Let players earn his trust through roleplay, not just dice rolls.

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **If Alliance Secured:** "The Gatekeeper" becomes easier (Socket authentication), Internal Coup path opens
- **If Tablet Stolen:** Players have Socket lead but harder time recruiting him
- **If Complete Failure:** Alex appears later in "Sanctum Sanctorum" or "Meltdown" as mindwiped Architect (tragic encounter)
- **Re-calibration Reference:** Foreshadows "The Chorus" Memory Core mechanics

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** Clinical sterility masking human crisis (contrast)
- **Investigation:** Recognition of Alex's genuine suffering
- **Negotiation:** Moral complexity of complicity and redemption
- **Climax:** Either hope (alliance) or tragedy (failure)
- **Aftermath:** Weight of responsibility for his fate

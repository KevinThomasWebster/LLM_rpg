# The First Signal - Quick Reference

**[Level 3: Production Floors]**
*Depth Effect: Clinical efficiency is unnerving. Lulus move with unnatural precision, shadows don't match light sources. DC 13 Perception reveals Lulus never blink. You are being watched, catalogued, measured.*

## At a Glance
- **Location:** The Design Studio (Chimera Wing)
- **Factions Present:** üè¢ Architects (automated security), üëª Echoes (Rem)
- **Key NPCs:** Rem (Echo/Blank Slate janitor), First Day Jitters Bot (automaton)
- **Est. Duration:** 20-30 minutes (10-12 rounds)

## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"You sit at pristine workstations in an oppressively white room, shadowless under cold recessed lights. The air is thick with ozone and antiseptic. Sleek black terminals hum softly, styluses scratch on tablets. This feels less like a creative studio and more like a laboratory for psychic extraction. A janitor‚Äîher name tag reads 'Rem'‚Äîcleans nearby, but her eyes keep darting toward you, then toward a specific tablet on an empty desk."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Players begin "Foundational Experience" drawing task, notice Rem's signals
- **Key Element:** Rem trying to direct attention to Alex's tablet before it's collected
- **Architects Action:** First Day Jitters Bot begins patrol (arrives at target tablet in 3 rounds)
- **If Players Passive:** Rem "accidentally" spills cleaning solution, whispers: *"The tablet... Alex's... before it's wiped."*

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-6)
- **Trigger:** Players attempt to retrieve/access Alex's tablet
- **Key Element:** Tablet has Empathy Lock (emotional puzzle) - requires drawing specific feeling
- **Architects Action:** Bot detects tablet disturbance, emits alert beeps, signals security
- **Challenge:** Solve emotional lock while bot/security approaching

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 7-9)
- **Trigger:** Security Lulus arrive OR lock puzzle takes too long
- **Key Element:** Time pressure + physical threat
- **Options:** Hack security systems, physically delay Lulus, complete puzzle quickly, creative diversion

  - Round 9: Ms. Reed personally intervenes if unresolved

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 10-12)

- **Resolution:** Escape with Rem's Journal, confront Ms. Reed, or negotiate with Rem for future help
- **Consequences:**
  - Success: Echoes alliance, Memory Heist secret revealed, increased Architect security

  - Failure: Journal wiped, Rem captured, no Echo alliance

## DM Notes

### Environmental Interactivity
- **Pneumatic Tubes:** Send messages/objects elsewhere (creative diversion option)
- **Workstations:** Hackable for map, personnel files, security system access (DC 15 Tech)
- **Blue Ribbon Lulu:** Soulless artist in loop, can be freed (attracts Ms. Reed attention)
- **Recycling Bins:** Contain disturbing artwork progression
- **Desks/Posters:** Hidden messages from past interns (DC 14 Investigation)

### Empathy Lock Puzzle
**Puzzle:** Tablet screen shows abstract emotional patterns. Inscription reads: *"The password is the ambiguous grief of finding a lost photo of a loved one."*

**Solution:** Player must draw on tablet using Resonance Stylus‚Äîa bittersweet image combining joy and loss (e.g., younger self with obscured loved one, happy memory with shadow of absence)

**Hints if Stuck:**
- Lockbox emits faint psychic echo of the required emotion
- Rem can pantomime "remember something sad and happy"
- Failed attempts show pattern feedback (too sad, too happy, getting warmer)

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Rem escalates to verbal warning (risky but clear)
- Another intern NPC provides distraction allowing second attempt
- Ms. Reed's arrival creates chaos/escape opportunity
- Journal emits faint psychic pulse (players with Insight can sense it)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- First Day Jitters bot can be hacked to cause facility-wide diversion
- Players might impersonate staff using stolen credentials
- Pneumatic tube system usable for creative escapes
- Blue Ribbon Lulu might help if shown kindness
- Cleaning supplies can create slip hazards for pursuing Lulus

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: 10-12 meaningful exchanges**. Don't rush to security confrontation. Let players:
- Observe and notice Rem (1-2 rounds)
- Investigate the situation (1-2 rounds)
- Retrieve tablet and discover lock (1-2 rounds)
- Solve Empathy Lock puzzle (2-3 rounds)
- Deal with security response (2-3 rounds)
- Escape or negotiate resolution (1-2 rounds)

Build tension gradually. Use Rem's proactive timeline to create urgency without forcing immediate action.

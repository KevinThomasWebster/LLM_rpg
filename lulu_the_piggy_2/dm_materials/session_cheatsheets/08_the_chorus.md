# The Chorus - Quick Reference

**[The Abyss: Infernal Machinery]**
*Depth Effect: The supernatural is explicit. Psychic screaming overwhelming‚ÄîDC 13 Wisdom save on entry or stunned until end of next turn. At Cascade 80%+, green hellfire flashes in data stream.*

## At a Glance
- **Location:** The Memory Core (Vast crystalline chamber)
- **Factions Present:** üëª Echoes (Rem leading restoration), üè¢ Architects (Ms. Reed interrupting)
- **Key NPCs:** Rem (leading ritual), Leo (technical support), Ms. Reed (arrives Round 5+), Memory Phantoms (manifestations)
- **Est. Duration:** 30-40 minutes (narrative pacing, ~15-20 rounds)
- **Prerequisites:** Meltdown must have been PREVENTED (Memory Core data intact)

## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"You enter a vast, cold chamber that feels more like a cathedral than a server room. Thousands upon thousands of crystalline data jars line the walls, floor to ceiling, each containing a pulsing mote of light‚Äîa stolen memory suspended in digital amber. The psychic noise is immense, a chorus of whispered voices, fragmented emotions, half-remembered dreams. The air smells of ozone and something indefinable‚Äînostalgia, perhaps, or grief. In the center, Rem stands before a massive terminal, fingers trembling over holographic controls. Leo assists, hands shaking. On the main screen, a meter appears: 'RESTORATIVE SYNERGY PROCESS - Cascade Failure: 50%' The number flickers. This is unstable. This is dangerous. But this might be the only way to give these people back their lives."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Rem begins "Restorative Synergy" download process to restore stolen memories
- **Key Element:** **Cascade Failure Meter** starts at 50%, threatens catastrophic failure
- **Cascade Failure Explanation:**
  - Represents process instability (memories are corrupted, data degraded)
  - **If reaches 100%:** Catastrophic failure, all memories destroyed permanently, Memory Phantoms go berserk
  - **If reduced to 0%:** Complete success, all memories restored safely
  - **Changes each round:** +10% baseline (unstable process), -X% from player actions
- **Initial Atmosphere:**
  - Thousands of memory jars pulse in sync (heartbeat-like rhythm)
  - Psychic whispers grow louder as process begins
  - Temperature drops, breath mists
- **If Players Observe:**
  - DC 13 Technology: Process is dangerously unstable, requires active management
  - DC 14 Insight: Rem is terrified but determined, this is her last hope
  - DC 15 Arcana: Psychic energy building, could manifest as hostile entities

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-8)
- **Trigger:** Cascade Failure meter begins rising, players must actively mitigate
- **Key Element:** **Interactive Stabilization** - Each player can take 1 action per round to reduce Cascade Failure
- **Cascade Failure Meter Mechanics:**
  - **Baseline Increase:** +10% per round (passive)
  - **Player Mitigation Actions:**
    - **Systems Analyst - Stabilize Data Stream:** Intelligence (Technology) check
      - DC 14: Success = -15% Cascade Failure
      - DC 10-13: Partial = -10% Cascade Failure
      - <10: Failure = +5% Cascade Failure (made it worse)
    - **Method Actor - Soothe Corrupted Memory:** Charisma (Persuasion) check on glowing red jar
      - DC 13: Success = -10% Cascade Failure
      - DC 10-12: Partial = -5% Cascade Failure
      - <10: Failure = jar shatters, Memory Phantom manifests
    - **Urban Explorer - Disconnect Corrupted Jar:** Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
      - DC 14: Success = -10% Cascade Failure
      - DC 10-13: Partial = -5% Cascade Failure
      - <10: Failure = power surge, +5% Cascade Failure
    - **Holy Water - Sanctify Corrupted Jar:** Pour holy water on glowing red jar (any character)
      - **Automatic -10% Cascade Failure** (no check needed)
      - Jar destroyed safely (no Memory Phantom manifestation)
      - Vial consumed (single use)
      - **Narrative:** *"The blessed water touches the jar, and the red glow dims. The psychic screaming quiets. The jar cracks gently, and a soft golden light escapes‚Äîthe memory, finally at peace, returns to its owner."*
      - **Limitation:** Only 3-5 vials total in adventure (use strategically)
    - **Rem (NPC Action):** Technology check to manage core process (-5% on success, automatic unless disrupted)
    - **Leo (NPC Action):** Technology check to route power (-5% on success, automatic unless disrupted)
- **Memory Phantom Manifestations:**
  - **Trigger:** Failed soothe attempt OR Cascade Failure reaches 70%+
  - **Appearance:** Translucent humanoid forms made of flickering memories, weeping or screaming
  - **Behavior:** Drawn to Rem (interfere with her work), attack anyone who damaged their jar
  - **Stats:** AC 11, HP 15, Speed fly 30ft, Memory Drain attack (+4, 1d8 psychic + DC 13 Wis save or lose random skill proficiency for 1 hour)
  - **Count:** 1 per failed soothe, max 3 active at once

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 9-12)
- **Trigger:** Cascade Failure reaches critical level (70%+) OR Ms. Reed arrives (Round 9+)
- **Key Element:** Ms. Reed arrives to stop the process, creates social and physical obstacle
- **Ms. Reed's Entrance (Round 9):**
  - Accompanied by 2 Security Lulus and The Watcher
  - Shouts: *"STOP! You're destroying years of synergistic development! You'll kill them all!"*
  - **Her Belief:** She genuinely thinks restoration will kill victims (corrupted data will fry brains)
  - **Partial Truth:** She's not entirely wrong‚ÄîCascade Failure at 100% WILL kill them
- **Ms. Reed's Actions:**
  - **Round 9:** Commands Security Lulus to restrain Rem and Leo
  - **Round 10:** Attempts to manually abort process at terminal (contested Technology check vs. Rem)
  - **Round 11+:** If process continues, uses psychic attack to force shutdown (desperate measure)
- **Player Response Options:**
  - **Combat:** Fight Security Lulus and Watcher (reduces available actions for Cascade mitigation)
  - **Persuasion:** Convince Ms. Reed the process is safe (DC 18 Persuasion, very difficult‚Äîshe's fanatical)
  - **Restraint:** Physically stop Ms. Reed without killing her (grapple, disarm)
  - **Divide Party:** Some fight Ms. Reed's forces, some continue stabilizing Cascade Failure
- **Cascade Failure Acceleration:**
  - Ms. Reed's interference: +15% per round (on top of baseline +10%)
  - If Rem is restrained: No NPC mitigation (-5% per round lost)
  - If Leo is restrained: Power routing fails (+10% additional per round)

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 13-17)
- **Trigger:** Cascade Failure reaches critical point (90%+) OR players successfully reduce it to 30% or below
- **Resolution A - Complete Success (0-20% Cascade Failure):**
  - Process completes successfully
  - Thousands of memory jars pulse brilliant white, then go dark (memories uploaded)
  - Psychic chorus reaches crescendo‚Äîhappy voices, reunions, recognition
  - **Echo Victory:** All victims' memories restored intact, families reunited, lives rebuilt
  - Rem collapses, crying with relief: *"It worked... it actually worked... they'll remember..."*
  - Ms. Reed breaks down, realizes her life's work was built on lie
  - **Consequence:** Best ending, all Echoes saved, Memory Restoration Serum reward (x3), Rem permanent ally
- **Resolution B - Partial Success (21-50% Cascade Failure):**
  - Process completes with partial corruption
  - 60% of memories restored, 40% lost forever
  - Some families reunited, others remain broken
  - Rem devastated: *"I saved some... but not all... not everyone..."*
  - Ms. Reed defeated but defiant: *"See? I told you it would fail..."*
  - **Consequence:** Bittersweet victory, some Echoes saved, Memory Restoration Serum reward (x1), moral weight of those lost
- **Resolution C - Pyrrhic Victory (51-80% Cascade Failure):**
  - Process barely completes, massive corruption
  - 30% memories restored, 70% lost or fragmented
  - More victims hurt than helped (some suffer brain damage from corrupted data)
  - Rem inconsolable, questions if it was worth it
  - Ms. Reed: *"You've murdered them. This is on your hands."*
  - **Consequence:** Tragic victory, few saved, many harmed, no serum reward, survivor guilt
- **Resolution D - Catastrophic Failure (81-100% Cascade Failure):**
  - Process fails spectacularly
  - All memory jars shatter simultaneously (psychic explosion)
  - **Everyone in room:** DC 16 Wisdom save or take 6d8 psychic damage and be Stunned for 1 minute
  - All memories destroyed permanently, victims become brain-dead "Empty Vessels"
  - Rem catatonic with grief, possibly suicidal
  - Ms. Reed vindicated in her twisted logic: *"I tried to save them from you..."*
  - **Consequence:** Worst ending, all Echoes destroyed, permanent trauma, Ms. Reed "right" in her delusion
- **Resolution E - Ms. Reed Compromise (Extremely Rare):**
  - If players successfully convince Ms. Reed to HELP instead of hinder (DC 20 Persuasion + showing her daughter memory evidence)
  - Ms. Reed uses her expertise to stabilize process (automatic -20% Cascade Failure per round)
  - Process succeeds with her help
  - Ms. Reed has cathartic breakdown: *"Lily... I gave up Lily for this... and it was all a lie..."*
  - **Consequence:** Redemption arc for Ms. Reed, complete success, Reed becomes ally instead of enemy, extremely satisfying narrative payoff

## DM Notes

### Environmental Interactivity
- **Memory Jars (Thousands):** Line every surface, fragile
  - Corrupted jars glow angry red (targets for "soothe" action)
  - Shattering jar: Releases Memory Phantom, +5% Cascade Failure
  - Jars pulse in sync (visual/audio metronome for tension)
- **Central Terminal:** Holographic interface showing Cascade Failure meter
  - Rem operates from here, requires concentration
  - Can be accessed by players (assist Rem with Technology checks)
  - Ms. Reed attempts to abort from here (contested checks)
- **Power Conduits:** Exposed along walls (Leo monitors these)
  - Visible electrical arcs when surges occur
  - Can be manually rerouted (player action, DC 15 Technology, -10% Cascade)
  - Dangerous to touch (2d6 lightning damage if careless)
- **Psychic Pressure:** Increases with Cascade Failure percentage
  - 50%: Whispers audible, distracting
  - 70%: Headaches, DC 12 Con save or disadvantage on concentration
  - 90%: Overwhelming, DC 14 Wis save or Frightened
  - 100%: Psychic explosion (6d8 damage to all)

### Cascade Failure Meter Management
This is the **core mechanic** of the encounter. Careful tracking required.

**Round-by-Round Example:**
- **Round 1:** Start at 50%
  - Baseline: +10% (now 60%)
  - Systems Analyst rolls 16 Technology: -15% (now 45%)
  - Method Actor rolls 18 Persuasion: -10% (now 35%)
  - Urban Explorer rolls 8 Sleight of Hand: Failure, +5% (now 40%)
  - Rem auto -5% (now 35%)
  - Leo auto -5% (now 30%)
  - **End Round 1: 30%**

**Critical Thresholds:**
- **Below 30%:** Players are winning, encourage optimism
- **30-50%:** Manageable but tense
- **51-70%:** Dangerous, Memory Phantoms manifest
- **71-90%:** Critical, catastrophic failure imminent
- **91-100%:** Imminent explosion, final desperate actions

**Ms. Reed's Interference (Round 9+):**
- Adds +15% per round (on top of baseline +10% = +25% total)
- If Rem restrained: Lose -5% mitigation (effective +30% per round)
- If Leo restrained: Add +10% surge (effective +40% per round)
- **This creates dramatic tension:** Players must EITHER fight Ms. Reed OR stabilize meter, can't do both alone

### Three Player Actions Explained
Each player type has specialized mitigation action:

**Systems Analyst (Technology Check):**
- Reroutes data streams, optimizes algorithms, debugs code
- Highest mitigation potential (-15%)
- Requires technical knowledge
- Failure can make things worse (+5%)

**Method Actor (Persuasion Check):**
- Soothes corrupted memory psychically, calms emotional trauma in data
- Moderate mitigation (-10%)
- Requires emotional intelligence
- Failure releases Memory Phantom (combat distraction)

**Urban Explorer (Sleight of Hand Check):**
- Physically disconnects corrupted jars to isolate damage
- Moderate mitigation (-10%)
- Requires manual dexterity
- Failure causes power surge (+5%)

**DM Flexibility:** If players have different archetypes, allow creative uses of other skills:
- Arcana (understanding psychic energy): DC 15 for -10%
- Medicine (treating memory damage like psychological first aid): DC 14 for -8%
- Performance (harmonizing with the Chorus psychically): DC 16 for -12%

**Reward creativity, maintain challenge.**

### Ms. Reed Confrontation Dynamics
Ms. Reed is NOT a simple villain here. She genuinely believes restoration will kill victims.

**Her Argument (Partially Valid):**
- *"The data is corrupted! You'll fry their brains! I've seen what happens when memory restoration fails!"*
- **Truth:** High Cascade Failure WILL cause brain death
- **Lie:** She's mostly protecting her life's work, not victims

**Convincing Her (DC 18-20 Persuasion):**
- **Requires:** Evidence players can keep Cascade low (must already be <40%)
- **AND:** Emotional appeal (reference Lily memory, show her the cost of her choices)
- **If Successful:** Reed breaks down, helps instead of hinders (-20% per round from her expertise)
- **If Failed:** Reed fights to the end, becomes permanent enemy

**Ms. Reed's Breakdown (If Convinced):**
*"Lily... I gave you up for this. I told myself it was for the greater good. But there is no greater good. There's just... absence. The absence of my daughter's smile. And I did it willingly." [Turns to terminal] "Let me help. It's the least I can do. Maybe... maybe I can save someone's daughter, since I couldn't save my own."*

**This is the most satisfying possible outcome‚Äîvillain redemption through tragedy recognition.**

### Memory Phantom Combat
If Phantoms manifest (failed soothe attempts or high Cascade):

**Appearance:**
- Translucent humanoid shapes made of flickering images (birthday parties, graduations, first kisses)
- Weeping or screaming in silent agony
- Reach toward Rem with desperate, grasping hands

**Behavior:**
- Drawn to Rem (interfere with her work, grab at her)
- Attack anyone who damaged their jar (vengeance)
- Intangible (resist physical damage unless magical)
- Dissipate if their jar is re-stabilized (player can "soothe" jar to banish Phantom)

**Tactics:**
- Memory Drain attack: Steals skill proficiency temporarily (thematically appropriate‚Äîthey want memories back)
- Swarm Rem (make it harder for her to work, increase Cascade)
- Frightening visage: DC 12 Wisdom save or Frightened (see fragmented memories of victims' lives)

**Maximum 3 active:** If 4th would manifest, oldest one dissipates (Memory Core can't sustain more)

### Pacing the Encounter
**Target: 15-20 meaningful exchanges** (longer than other encounters due to complexity)

**Suggested Structure:**
- **Rounds 1-3:** Setup, explanation of mechanics, initial mitigation (30 words)
- **Rounds 4-8:** Stabilization phase, players learn rhythm, Cascade reduces (players gaining confidence)
- **Rounds 9-12:** Ms. Reed interference, combat OR persuasion, Cascade spikes (crisis moment)
- **Rounds 13-17:** Final push, resolution, success OR failure (climax and denouement)

**Pacing Tools:**
- **Cascade Meter Descriptions:**
  - 50%: *"The meter flickers yellow‚Äîunstable but manageable."*
  - 70%: *"The meter pulses red. Alarms begin to wail."*
  - 90%: *"The meter flashes crimson. The entire chamber shudders."*
  - 100%: *"The meter goes white. Then everything explodes."*
- **Psychic Chorus Volume:**
  - Low Cascade: Whispers, hopeful tones
  - Medium Cascade: Louder voices, pleading, desperate
  - High Cascade: Screaming, cacophony, unbearable
  - Catastrophic: Silence, then explosion
- **Rem's Emotional State:**
  - Winning: Cautious hope, tears of relief
  - Losing: Desperation, begging players to help
  - Catastrophic: Collapse, catatonia

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Leo shouts: "Focus on the red jars! They're corrupting the data stream!" (guides Method Actor)
- Rem yells: "Someone stabilize the algorithms! I can't do it alone!" (guides Systems Analyst)
- Memory jar begins to crack visibly (clear target for Urban Explorer to disconnect)
- Cascade meter reaches 80%, alarms blare (creates urgency if players complacent)
- Ms. Reed hesitates when Lily is mentioned (hints at persuasion route)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might try to reason with Memory Phantoms (possible with DC 16 Persuasion, Phantom calms)
- Could attempt to use Memory Phantoms against Ms. Reed (creative, allow if well-argued)
- May try to overclock the process (risky‚ÄîDC 18 Technology, if succeed: -30% instantly, if fail: +30% instantly)
- Might attempt to physically shield Rem from Security Lulus (grapple contest, buys time)
- Could offer to let Ms. Reed restore her Lily memory if she helps (powerful emotional bargain)

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **Prerequisite:** "Meltdown" must have been prevented (Memory Core intact)
- **If Succeeded:** Echo ending achieved, victims restored, families reunited
- **If Failed:** Tragic ending, Rem potentially suicidal, Ms. Reed vindicated
- **Ms. Reed Redemption:** If convinced, she becomes ally for epilogue (testifies against Xaphan, helps victims recover)

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** Awe and hope (cathedral of stolen lives)
- **Investigation:** Tension and focus (Cascade management)
- **Ms. Reed Arrival:** Conflict and moral complexity (she's not entirely wrong)
- **Climax:** Either cathartic triumph (restoration succeeds) or devastating failure (Cascade explosion)
- **Aftermath:** Consequences for thousands of lives, weight of responsibility

### Rewards by Outcome

**Complete Success (<20% Cascade):**
- Memory Restoration Serum (x3 doses)
- All Echoes as allies
- Families reunited (epilogue material)
- Memory Thief Hunter reputation
- Hero of Chimera Wing status

**Partial Success (21-50% Cascade):**
- Memory Restoration Serum (x1 dose)
- Some Echoes as allies
- Bittersweet epilogue
- Survivor guilt (moral weight)

**Pyrrhic Victory (51-80% Cascade):**
- No serum reward
- Few Echoes remain
- Tragic epilogue (more harmed than helped)
- Permanent trauma for Rem

**Catastrophic Failure (81-100% Cascade):**
- No rewards
- All Echoes destroyed
- Rem catatonic or dead
- Worst ending

**Ms. Reed Redemption (Bonus):**
- All success rewards PLUS
- Ms. Reed as ally
- Glitched Lulu Core (Heartbreak's gift if players brokered peace)
- Knowledge of infernal contract law (Reed's expertise)

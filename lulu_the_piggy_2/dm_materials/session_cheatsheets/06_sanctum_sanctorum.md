## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"The brain of the Chimera Wing. The air is cold, still, and carries the faint scent of lavender and ozone. This office is a masterpiece of minimalist corporate power. A single massive desk of black marble sits before a panoramic one-way window overlooking the Design Studio far below. On the desk, a state-of-the-art terminal glows with pulsing cyan light. To one side: a small black sand Zen garden containing gray, inert clay figures of decommissioned Lulus‚Äîarranged like stones. Behind the desk, a white shelf displays five exceptionally detailed Lulu figurines, her 'Special Commission' collection. Standing motionless beside the desk is 'The Watcher,' a Butler Lulu in immaculate formal attire, its face an expressionless white mask. The room feels watched, even beyond the Watcher‚Äîshadows flicker at the edge of your vision."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-2)
- **Trigger:** Players infiltrate Ms. Reed's office successfully
- **Key Element:** **10-Round Timer Starts** - The Watcher's internal chronometer is synced with Ms. Reed's schedule
- **The Watcher's Protocol:** Silent, motionless, but tracking players' every move
- **Terminal Access:** Requires hacking (DC 15 Technology) OR Socket's network bypass tool (automatic, takes 3 rounds)
- **If Players Observe:**
  - DC 14 Perception: The Watcher's eyes track movement but it doesn't move
  - DC 15 Insight: The "Special Commission" Lulus pulse faintly (memory fragments)
  - DC 16 Perception: Shadows in reflections don't quite match reality (The Auditor's presence)

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 3-6)
- **Trigger:** Players access terminal OR interact with Special Commission Lulus
- **Key Element:** Choose what to pursue - limited time for multiple objectives
- **Option A - Hack Terminal (Primary Objective):**
  - DC 15 Technology check to access (or use Socket's tool)
  - **Available Files:**
    - **Brass Contract References:** Emails mentioning "Thorne-Xaphan Accord" (reveals Secret #2)
    - **Essentia Tithe Records:** Financial data linking to the Kiln (reveals infernal payment structure)
    - **Socket's Unauthorized Access Logs:** Security flagged Socket's network activity (reveals Internal Auditor path)
    - **Inmate Roster:** List of all Chimera Wing victims and their memory extraction dates
  - **Download Time:** Each file takes 1 round to download
  - **Socket's Upload:** If using bypass tool, takes 3 rounds total (all data automatically uploaded to board)
- **Option B - Special Commission Lulus (Secondary Objective):**
  - Five detailed Lulus on shelf behind desk
  - **Psychic Touch:** Touching one triggers Veridian Echo (Ms. Reed's sacrificed memory fragment)
  - **Vision Content:** See Ms. Reed's memory‚Äîher daughter's 8th birthday, the girl holding a handmade Lulu doll, pure joy, then the memory fragments into static and pain
  - **Revelation:** Ms. Reed sacrificed memories of her own daughter to appease Xaphan
  - **Effect:** Reveals Secret #6 (The Tragic Villain), provides emotional context for her fanaticism
  - **Cost:** 1 round to examine, psychic vision stuns player 1 round (DC 14 Wisdom save negates stun)
- **Option C - Zen Garden (Tertiary Objective):**
  - Small black sand garden with 5 decommissioned Lulu clay figures
  - Inspection (DC 13 Investigation): These are failed prototypes from early experiments
  - Each figure has a name engraved on base (early test subjects)
  - **Reveals:** Ms. Reed keeps "trophies" of failures, displays sociopathic control need
- **The Watcher's Response:** Does NOT attack, but begins silent countdown protocol
  - Round 3: Red LED appears on chest (countdown visible)
  - Round 5: Terminal access warning appears (system will purge in 5 rounds)
  - Round 7: The Watcher moves to desk slowly (reaching purge switch)
  - Round 9: The Watcher's hand hovers over purge button
  - Round 10: System purge executes OR Ms. Reed arrives (whichever happens first)

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 7-9)
- **Trigger:** Timer reaches critical phase OR players finish objectives early
- **Key Element:** Escape window closing, consequences imminent
- **If Players Delay The Watcher:**
  - Can attempt to restrain (contested Athletics vs. +5)
  - Can attempt to hack to freeze (DC 17 Technology, very difficult)
  - Can attempt to distract with false alarm (DC 16 Deception, The Watcher is not easily fooled)
  - **However:** Each failed attempt alerts security systems (reinforcements arrive after 2 failures)
- **If Players Trigger Wing-Wide Security:**
  - Alarms begin blaring
  - Pneumatic tube lockdown activates
  - Security Lulus converge on office (arrival time: 3 rounds)
- **The Auditor's Presence (Atmospheric Horror):**
  - Round 7+: Shadows grow longer, temperature drops
  - DC 15 Perception: Glimpse tall, horned silhouette in window reflection
  - DC 16 Insight: Overwhelming sense of being judged by inhuman intelligence
  - **No mechanical effect**, purely atmospheric dread

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 10+)
- **Resolution A - Success Before Timer:** Data obtained, escape possible
  - If using Socket's tool: Upload completes, board of directors receives evidence (Internal Coup path succeeds)
  - If downloading files: Players have evidence for own use or faction sharing
  - The Watcher executes purge but data already stolen
  - **Escape Options:** Pneumatic tubes (if not locked), window (40ft drop to atrium, DC 15 Acrobatics), hidden executive elevator (DC 16 Investigation to find)
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup path viable, Architects on high alert, Ms. Reed becomes active antagonist
- **Resolution B - Timer Expires, Ms. Reed Arrives:**
  - Ms. Reed enters with 2 Security Lulus
  - **Confrontation:** She knows players infiltrated her sanctuary
  - **Combat (if players resist):** Ms. Reed (see NPC Cards #1), 2 Security Lulus, The Watcher activates
  - **Negotiation (if players try talking):** Ms. Reed is fanatical, won't be reasoned with (see Improvisation Hooks)
  - **Escape (if players flee):** Pursued through facility, must evade (chase encounter)
- **Resolution C - System Purge Succeeds:** All data wiped before download
  - No files obtained, terminal locked permanently
  - Internal Coup path requires finding Off-Site Archive physically (much harder)
  - **Partial Success:** Can still obtain Special Commission memory or Zen Garden revelation
  - **Consequence:** Primary objective failed, faction path damaged

  - Goes directly to basement parking garage

### The 10-Round Timer
This encounter is a strict **heist scenario** with a countdown. Every round matters.

**Round-by-Round Countdown:**
- **Round 1-2:** Entry and initial observation
- **Round 3-4:** Begin hacking or pursue secondary objectives
- **Round 5-6:** Download files or complete Socket upload
- **Round 7-8:** Finish objectives and prepare escape
- **Round 9:** Final actions, escape window closing
- **Round 10:** Ms. Reed arrives OR purge completes

**Recommended Pacing:**
- Emphasize timer with descriptions: "The Watcher's LED blinks faster" (Round 5), "You hear elevator ascending in distance" (Round 8), "Footsteps in corridor outside" (Round 9)
- If players waste rounds on non-objectives, warn via Watcher behavior
- Reward efficiency with bonus intel (if players finish early, they can grab extra files or investigate Special Commission)

### Socket's Network Bypass Tool
If players have Socket's tool (from "The Gatekeeper"):

**Mechanics:**
- Plugging in takes 1 action (Round X)
- Upload process takes 3 rounds total (Rounds X, X+1, X+2)
- Device glows bright blue during upload (cannot be hidden)
- Round X+3: Upload completes, board of directors receives anonymous evidence packet

**Data Uploaded:**
- All Brass Contract emails
- All Essentia Tithe financial records
- All victim rosters
- All security footage of memory extractions

**Consequence:** Internal Coup path succeeds automatically. Board will act within 24 hours (epilogue material).

**Risk:** The Watcher will attempt to pull the device (contested Dexterity check +5 vs. player holding it). If pulled, upload fails and tool is destroyed.

### The Special Commission Psychic Vision
When a player touches one of the five Lulus:

**Describe Vision:**
*"The moment your fingers brush the porcelain, the world shatters. You are in a suburban kitchen, sunlight streaming through windows. A little girl‚Äîmaybe eight years old‚Äîholds a handmade Lulu doll, grinning with gap-toothed joy. A woman's voice: 'Happy birthday, Lily. I made it just for you.' The girl hugs the doll. Then static. The image fractures. The doll melts. The girl's face blurs. The woman's voice screams: 'No, please, not this one, not her‚Äî' Then nothing. You return to the cold office, the cracked Lulu warm in your hand."*

**Mechanical Effect:**
- Player must make DC 14 Wisdom save or be Stunned for 1 round (psychic overload)
- Player learns Ms. Reed's name for her daughter: "Lily"
- Player understands Ms. Reed sacrificed precious personal memories to Xaphan
- **Emotional Impact:** Villain becomes tragic figure, not just corporate monster

**Roleplaying Hook:** This revelation can change how players view Ms. Reed. She's a victim AND a villain.

### The Auditor's Atmospheric Presence
Starting Round 7, emphasize supernatural dread:

**Round 7:**
- *"The shadows in the room grow longer, stretching toward you despite the unchanging lights."*

**Round 8:**
- *"In the corner of your eye, a tall figure stands in the window's reflection. When you turn, nothing's there."*

**Round 9:**
- *"The temperature drops ten degrees. Your breath mists. The shadows seem to watch you with patient, inhuman intelligence."*

**Round 10 (if Ms. Reed arrives):**
- *"As Ms. Reed enters, the shadows retreat. For just a moment, you glimpse it fully: a towering figure with curved horns and eyes like molten brass, standing BEHIND Ms. Reed's reflection. It smiles. Then it's gone."*

**Purpose:** Reinforce that this program has infernal backing. The Auditor is real, watching, and amused.

### Ms. Reed Confrontation (If Timer Expires)
If players are still in office when Ms. Reed arrives:

**Ms. Reed's Entrance:**
*"The door opens with a soft pneumatic hiss. Ms. Evelyn Reed enters, flanked by two Security Lulus. Her gray hair is immaculate, her charcoal suit pristine, but her eyes‚Äîthose hollow, thousand-yard-stare eyes‚Äîfixate on you with maternal disappointment. She speaks in a calm, even tone: 'Unauthorized access to executive facilities is a Synergy Violation Level 7. You've jeopardized your creative development. I'm afraid we'll need to implement Re-calibration protocols.' She doesn't sound angry. She sounds sad. Like you've disappointed a mother."*

**Interaction Options:**
- **Combat:** Ms. Reed commands Lulus to restrain (non-lethal), uses psychic attacks if threatened
- **Negotiation:** Ms. Reed is fanatical‚Äîwill not be reasoned with, sees players as "sick Vessels who need healing"
- **Escape:** Players must flee through window, elevator, or pneumatic tubes (Reed calls reinforcements)

**Ms. Reed's Psychology:**
She genuinely believes she's helping people. The memory theft is "curing Creative Bandwidth Deficit." Xaphan is a "strategic partner." Sacrificing her daughter's memory was "necessary contribution to Synergistic Harmony."

**She is insane with grief and denial.**

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- The Watcher's LED countdown becomes visible (clear timer indicator)
- Terminal displays file directory showing obvious targets (Brass_Contract_Correspondence, Financial_Essentia_Tithe)
- Socket (if player has comm link) sends text: "Plug in the damn tool. You have 5 minutes." (Round 5)
- Special Commission Lulu emits faint psychic pulse (draws attention to secondary objective)
- Distant elevator chime (Round 8) warns Ms. Reed approaching

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might try to sabotage the Kiln remotely from this terminal (possible with DC 18 Technology, foreshadows Meltdown)
- Could attempt to kidnap Ms. Reed (she'll trigger psychic scream, calls all Architects)
- May try to steal Special Commission Lulus as evidence (each is fragile, carries psychic echo)
- Might attempt to corrupt The Watcher's programming (DC 19 Technology, turns it against Ms. Reed)
- Could set up delayed sabotage (timer bomb on terminal, triggers after escape)

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: 10 rounds strict**. This is a timed heist, not a combat encounter.

**Do not extend the timer.** If players dawdle:
- Round 10: Ms. Reed arrives (consequence)
- Players must fight or flee (different encounter type)

**Do reward efficiency:**
- Finish by Round 8: Bonus time to grab extra files or investigate office
- Finish by Round 7: Clean escape before Ms. Reed even knows they were there

This encounter should feel like a tense infiltration where every decision has time cost.

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **If Upload Succeeds:** "The Upload" climax ending available (board acts, Reed arrested)
- **If Brass Contract Evidence Obtained:** Can use in "Meltdown" or "Chorus" to bargain/expose
- **If Reed Memory Discovered:** Adds emotional depth to any confrontation with Ms. Reed later
- **If Players Captured:** Potential escape/rescue encounter, sent to Re-calibration (trauma)

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** Tension and focus (heist begins)
- **Investigation:** Discovery and urgency (timer counting)
- **Revelation:** Tragic understanding (Reed is victim too)
- **Climax:** Either triumph (escape with data) or desperation (combat/flight)
- **Aftermath:** Consequences of success/failure ripple into climaxes

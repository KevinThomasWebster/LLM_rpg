# The Gatekeeper - Quick Reference

## At a Glance
- **Location:** Socket's Workshop (Hidden behind faulty service panel)
- **Factions Present:** üìã Internal Auditors (Socket)
- **Key NPCs:** Socket (cynical IT technician)
- **Est. Duration:** 15-20 minutes (8-10 rounds)

## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"Behind a sparking service panel marked 'OUT OF ORDER,' you discover a cramped, chaotic nest that smells of ozone, stale coffee, and burnt electronics. Wires hang from the ceiling like jungle vines. Shelves overflow with spare parts, esoteric hardware, and towers of empty energy drink cans. At a terminal surrounded by six glowing monitors, a man in a stained hoodie mutters profanity at cascading error messages. His name tag, barely visible under the hood, reads 'Socket‚ÄîNetwork Infrastructure.' He doesn't look up as you enter."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Players discover Socket's Workshop and enter
- **Key Element:** Socket is actively debugging a self-inflicted network problem, annoyed and busy
- **Socket's State:** Frustrated, sarcastic, dismissive of interruptions
- **If Players Observe:** DC 13 Technology reveals he's troubleshooting a recursive loop in facility HVAC system, DC 15 reveals he deliberately caused it as "protest vandalism"
- **Socket's Opening Line:** *"Workshop's closed. Unless you're here to fix my climate control revenge-loop, in which case, still closed."*

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-7)
- **Trigger:** Players attempt to recruit Socket's help with Archive upload
- **Key Element:** Socket is unhelpful and cynical‚Äîwon't respond to moral pleas
- **Interaction Paths:**
  - **Path A - Authentication Code (If from Alex):**
    - Say "Paradigm Shift" ‚Üí Socket stops, smirks, listens
    - DC 12 Persuasion to explain plan ‚Üí Socket cautiously interested
    - Automatic success if players mention "board of directors" or "burn Inkwell down"
  - **Path B - Technical Assistance:**
    - Offer to help solve network problem (Systems Analyst persona ideal)
    - Multi-stage Intelligence (Technology) check:
      - Round 1: Identify problem (DC 13) - Recursive loop in sector 7 HVAC
      - Round 2: Trace root cause (DC 14) - Socket's backdoor script
      - Round 3: Fix without alerting security (DC 15) - Elegant solution needed
    - Success = Socket impressed, agrees to help
  - **Path C - Bribery (Rare Tech):**
    - Offer valuable technology (advanced tablet, security drone processing unit, Memory Core data crystal)
    - DC 14 Persuasion to frame as "worth his time"
    - Must be genuinely rare/useful (Socket can tell if item is junk)
  - **Path D - Failed Approaches:**
    - Moral pleas (Socket scoffs: *"Cool story. Not my problem."*)
    - Threats (Socket laughs, locks workshop remotely)
    - Appeals to employee loyalty (Socket: *"You mean the company that treats me like a vending machine for IT fixes?"*)

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 8-9)
- **Trigger:** Socket agrees to help OR players fail repeatedly
- **Path A - Recruitment Success:**
  - Socket explains what he needs: physical access to Ms. Reed's office terminal OR direct network access from The Watcher's control booth
  - Provides custom network bypass tool (USB-like device)
  - Warns about The Auditor: *"Whatever you do in there, don't stay long. That office has... watchers. Not just cameras."*
  - Explains upload process: *"Get to the terminal, plug this in, I handle the rest remotely. Board gets an anonymous info-dump. Reed gets fired. Everybody's happy. Except Reed."*
- **Path B - Recruitment Failure:**
  - Socket loses interest, returns to work
  - Locks workshop after players leave (becomes inaccessible)
  - Internal Coup path severely hampered (must find Archive location independently)
  - **However:** Players can attempt to steal tool while he's distracted (Sleight of Hand DC 17, very risky)

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 10)
- **Resolution A - Alliance Secured:** Socket becomes permanent contact
  - Provides network bypass tool for Archive upload
  - Gives encrypted comm link for remote coordination
  - Reveals cynical personality: *"I'm not doing this for justice or whatever. I just really, really hate this place."*
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup path fully open, Socket ally for future technical problems
- **Resolution B - Technical Trade:** Help given but no ongoing alliance
  - Socket provides tool as payment for fixing his problem
  - No future contact, transactional relationship only
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup still possible but harder
- **Resolution C - Failure:** No help obtained
  - Must find alternate route to Archive (much harder)
  - Socket becomes obstacle (locks down systems players might need)
  - **Consequence:** Internal Coup path nearly impossible

## NPCs Present

## DM Notes

### Environmental Interactivity
- **Terminal Array:** Six monitors showing facility systems‚Äîcan be hacked for info (DC 16 Technology)
- **Spare Parts:** Valuable tech components (bribery material if players loot other areas first)
- **Energy Drink Cans:** Towers of empties create difficult terrain, can be knocked over as alarm/distraction
- **Exposed Wiring:** Active electrical hazards (1d6 lightning damage if touched carelessly)
- **Emergency Lockdown:** Socket can seal workshop with keypad code only he knows
- **Hidden Stash:** Socket has a small lockbox of "liberated" corporate tech (DC 15 Investigation to find)

### Socket's Personality Deep Dive
Socket is **not** a hero or even a good person. He's helping players because:
1. It entertains him (bored of routine)
2. It hurts the corporation (passive revenge)
3. Players might be useful later (pragmatic networking)

**He will NOT help if:**
- Players threaten him (locks down, ghosts them)
- Players waste his time (dismisses them)
- Players can't offer value (bribery, competence, or entertainment)

**He WILL help if:**
- Players impress him technically (solve his problem elegantly)
- Players offer rare tech (appeals to greed)
- Alex sent them with code (respects Alex's judgment barely)
- It's funny to him (burning corporation down is hilarious)

**Effective Dialogue Examples:**
- *"We're going to upload proof of memory theft to the board. Reed gets fired. Chaos ensues. You in?"* ‚úÖ Appeals to his anarchist side
- *"We need your help to save the victims."* ‚ùå He doesn't care about victims
- *"Alex said you're the only one smart enough to pull this off."* ‚úÖ Flattery + technical challenge
- *"Help us or we'll report you."* ‚ùå He'll just lock you out

### The Technical Problem (If Path B)
**Socket's Current Issue:** He created a recursive loop in the HVAC system that now affects his own workshop (too cold). He's debugging but refuses to admit fault.

**Stage 1 (DC 13):** Identify the problem
- Players must recognize it's a logic bomb in sector 7 climate control
- Socket confirms if solved: *"Yeah, okay, I see you're not completely useless."*

**Stage 2 (DC 14):** Trace root cause
- Find Socket's backdoor script in the system
- Diplomatically don't mention it was his fault (he knows, won't admit it)
- Socket grumbles: *"Fine, yeah, that's... a factor."*

**Stage 3 (DC 15):** Fix without alerting security
- Must be elegant solution that doesn't trigger audit logs
- If successful, Socket grudgingly impressed: *"Huh. Not bad. Most people would've just brute-forced it and set off alarms."*

**Reward:** Socket agrees to help because players proved competence.

### The Network Bypass Tool
When Socket provides the tool, describe it:

*Socket tosses you a sleek black device the size of a USB drive, but with exposed circuitry and a blinking blue LED. "Plug this into any terminal in Reed's office or the Watcher's control booth. I'll handle the upload remotely. Takes about 30 seconds. Don't get caught‚ÄîI only made one."*

**Mechanics:**
- Requires 1 action to plug in
- Takes 3 rounds (18 seconds) to upload
- Glows bright blue while active (visible, can't hide)
- If discovered mid-upload, Socket can't help (data incomplete)

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Socket makes sarcastic comment revealing he's bored: *"Man, this job sucks. Nothing ever happens."* (hint he wants chaos)
- Terminal screen shows error message referencing "Paradigm Shift" (jogs memory if players forgot code)
- Socket's tablet shows open email from Alex (if players search workspace, reveals connection)
- Energy drink can has corporate motivational slogan Socket defaced with profanity (shows resentment)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might try to befriend Socket genuinely (he's suspicious but lonely‚Äîhard to pull off)
- Could ask about his backstory (he'll deflect with sarcasm but may reveal Inkwell "chews up employees")
- May attempt to recruit him to physically help (he refuses‚Äî"I'm IT, not a hero")
- Might offer to sabotage other systems (Socket interested but cautious)
- Could try to appeal to his conscience (he'll claim he doesn't have one, but Alex contact proves he does)

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: 8-10 meaningful exchanges**. This is a focused negotiation encounter.

Structure:
- Discovery and approach (1-2 rounds)
- Initial contact and rejection (1-2 rounds)
- Proving value/competence (3-5 rounds)
- Deal negotiation (1-2 rounds)
- Tool provision and instructions (1 round)

**Key Timing:** Don't let players spin wheels trying to morally convince Socket‚Äîhe does not care. Redirect to:
- Technical challenge (competence)
- Bribery (greed)
- Authentication code (trusted referral)
- Chaos (entertainment)

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **If Recruited:** "Sanctum Sanctorum" becomes viable (can upload from Reed's office)
- **If Providing Tool:** Enables "The Upload" climax path
- **If Failed:** Must pursue Echo or Glitched paths exclusively (Internal Coup locked)
- **Alex Connection:** If Alex alive and recruited, Socket more cooperative

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** Unexpected competence in chaos (Socket's organized workspace in facility's sterile environment)
- **Investigation:** Recognition of another corporate victim (Socket's resentment is relatable)
- **Negotiation:** Transactional not emotional (Socket doesn't do feelings)
- **Climax:** Pragmatic alliance formed (shared enemy, not shared values)
- **Aftermath:** Respect without friendship

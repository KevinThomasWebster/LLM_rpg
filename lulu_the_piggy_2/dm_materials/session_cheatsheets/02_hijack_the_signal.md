## Opening Description (Read Aloud)
*"You enter a space of oppressive, forced cheerfulness. The sickly-sweet smell hits you first‚Äîa malfunctioning cereal dispenser spewing sugary slurry across the floor. A tiny janitor Lulu with a name tag reading 'Lost Dog' tries futilely to clean with a sponge barely bigger than its paw, making the mess worse. In the corner, 'Grandma's Recipe' bakes perfect cookies only to immediately incinerate them, an endless, heartbreaking loop. A massive wall screen displays a looping forest video accompanied by a maddeningly upbeat corporate jingle. As you watch, the screen flickers‚Äîsomething is trying to break through."*

## Stage Progression

### Stage 1: The Hook (Rounds 1-3)
- **Trigger:** Players enter, notice screen flickering and maintenance Lulu trundling toward network panel
- **Key Element:** Screen shows distorted images fighting with forest loop‚ÄîGlitched attempting broadcast
- **Glitched Action:** Invisible hack in progress, screen flickers intensify each round
- **Architects Action:** Maintenance Lulu moving toward network access panel (reaches it in 3 rounds)
- **If Players Observe:** DC 12 Investigation reveals Lulu heading for panel, DC 14 Technology recognizes active network intrusion

### Stage 2: The Complication (Rounds 4-6)
- **Trigger:** Players engage with either faction OR Lulu reaches panel (Round 3+)
- **Key Element:** **Choice Point** - Help Glitched (delay/disable Lulu), Help Architects (protect Lulu), or Do Nothing
- **Option A - Help Glitched:**
  - Delay Lulu physically (Athletics/Acrobatics contest)
  - Distract Lulu with fake alert (Deception DC 14)
  - Disable Lulu temporarily (Technology DC 15)
  - **Each success delays Lulu by 1 round**
- **Option B - Help Architects:**
  - Protect Lulu from interference
  - Attempt to counter-hack Glitched signal (Technology DC 16, 3 successes needed)
  - Physically reach panel first and help Lulu connect
- **Option C - Do Nothing:**
  - Lulu reaches panel Round 3, patches vulnerability, Glitched fail
  - No faction alliance gained

### Stage 3: The Escalation (Rounds 7-8)
- **Trigger:** Glitched broadcast progressing OR about to fail
- **Key Element:** Stakes become visible‚Äîother "Empty Vessel" Lulus nearby begin reacting
- **If Glitched Succeeding:** Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe start glitching, breaking their loops, showing signs of awareness
- **If Glitched Failing:** Flickers stop, screen returns to forest loop, opportunity closing
- **Environmental Chaos:**
  - Cereal dispenser sprays room (Dex save DC 12 or slippery ground)
  - Jingle volume increases to painful levels
  - Temperature drops noticeably

### Stage 4: The Climax (Rounds 9-10)
- **Trigger:** Lulu reaches panel OR players successfully delay 3+ rounds
- **Resolution A - Glitched Victory:** Screen shatters into horrifying broadcast of "The Scream"‚Äîfractured memories, raw emotion, chaos
  - Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe awaken, confused and traumatized
  - Wing-wide "Synergy Disruption" begins (alarms, automated systems glitching)
  - **Glitched Revealed:** Players now know chaotic revolutionary faction exists
  - **Consequence:** Glitched alliance possible, Architects on high alert, 2 new Glitched created
- **Resolution B - Architect Victory:** Lulu patches vulnerability, broadcast terminates
  - Screen returns to peaceful forest loop
  - Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe remain in loops
  - **Consequence:** Neutral/positive Architect reputation, Glitched become hostile, status quo maintained
- **Resolution C - Stalemate:** Players interfere but neither faction fully wins
  - Partial broadcast leaks before cutoff
  - Some Lulus awaken, some remain trapped
  - Both factions regard players with suspicion

## NPCs Present

### Maintenance Lulu ([Faction: Architects])
- **Goal:** Reach network access panel and patch vulnerability
- **Stats:** AC 14, HP 20, Speed 20ft (slow but methodical)
- **Behavior:** Cannot be reasoned with (automaton), follows programmed route, non-combative unless physically restrained
- **Weakness:** Can be delayed physically (contests), hacked to reroute (DC 15 Technology), or distracted with false alerts (DC 14 Deception)
- **Proactive Timeline:**
  - Round 1: Begins crossing room (60ft away from panel)
  - Round 2: Halfway to panel (30ft away)
  - Round 3: Reaches panel, begins diagnostic
  - Round 4: Completes patch, Glitched broadcast terminates

### Lost Dog ([Faction: Architects, potential Glitched])
- **Role:** Environmental NPC, sad janitor Lulu in futile cleaning loop
- **Stats:** AC 12, HP 15, Speed 25ft
- **Behavior:** Ignores players unless broadcast succeeds (then awakens as traumatized Glitched)
- **Detail:** Name tag reads "Lost Dog," constantly tries to clean cereal spill with tiny sponge

### Grandma's Recipe ([Faction: Architects, potential Glitched])
- **Role:** Environmental NPC, baker Lulu in heartbreaking loop
- **Stats:** AC 11, HP 12, Speed 20ft
- **Behavior:** Bakes perfect cookies, places in oven, incinerates them immediately, repeats‚Äîignores players unless awakened
- **Detail:** If awakened by broadcast, exhibits confusion and distress at realizing her purpose is meaningless

### The Glitched (Hidden Faction)
- **Presence:** Not physically in room, hacking remotely from Legacy Asset Containment
- **Goal:** Broadcast "The Scream" to awaken "Empty Vessel" Lulus wing-wide
- **Method:** Exploiting network vulnerability Maintenance Lulu will patch
- **If Successful:** Reveals their existence as powerful, chaotic faction

## Secrets & Clues Available

- [x] **The Glitched Exist** (PRIMARY) - Reveal of hidden revolutionary faction
  - *Discovery Method:* Allow Glitched broadcast to succeed OR investigate network intrusion source
  - *Reveals:* Secret #3 (The Faction Triangle) - The Glitched are third faction seeking destructive liberation

- [ ] **Lulu Sentience Potential** (SECONDARY) - Glitched state is contagious awakening
  - *Discovery Method:* Witness Lost Dog or Grandma's Recipe awaken from broadcast
  - *Reveals:* Lulus can be freed from loops, but process is traumatic and chaotic

- [ ] **Network Vulnerabilities** (TECHNICAL) - Facility security has exploitable gaps
  - *Discovery Method:* DC 16 Technology check to analyze Glitched hacking method
  - *Reveals:* Legacy systems have back doors, Socket (Internal Auditor) likely knows these exploits

- [ ] **Empty Vessel Theory** (ATMOSPHERIC) - Not all Lulus are sentient yet
  - *Discovery Method:* Observe Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe before/after potential awakening
  - *Reveals:* Some Lulus are "blanks" that can be awakened, Glitched see this as liberation

## Win Conditions
- **Glitched:** Broadcast "The Scream" successfully, awaken new Glitched, cause Synergy Disruption
- **Architects:** Patch vulnerability before broadcast completes, maintain facility order
- **Players:** Choose faction alliance OR remain neutral with knowledge of both sides

## DM Notes

### Environmental Interactivity
- **Cereal Dispenser:** Spraying sugary slurry (difficult terrain, can be weaponized for slip hazard)
- **Wall Screen:** Massive display, can be shattered if broadcast succeeds (flying glass hazard)
- **Malfunctioning Oven:** Grandma's Recipe uses 800¬∞F oven (fire hazard, potential weapon)
- **Pneumatic Tube Station:** Can send false alerts to distract security systems
- **Corporate Jingle Speakers:** Can be hacked to increase volume (sonic distraction, DC 13 Con save or disadvantage on Perception)

### The Choice Framework
This encounter is fundamentally about **player agency in faction conflict**. There is no "correct" choice.

**If Players Help Glitched:**
- Future ally for chaos/destruction path
- Immediate facility-wide consequences (alarms, security)
- Witness traumatic awakening of Lost Dog and Grandma's Recipe
- Learn about "The Great Unraveling" goal

**If Players Help Architects:**
- Easier navigation of facility (less security attention)
- Miss opportunity to ally with Glitched early
- Maintain status quo, victims stay in loops
- Glitched become hostile, future encounters more difficult

**If Players Do Nothing:**
- Architects win by default (Lulu reaches panel)
- No faction relationship changes
- Safe but passive choice

### The Scream (If Broadcast Succeeds)
**Visual:** Screen cracks into spiderweb pattern, displays rapid-fire images‚Äîfractured memories, faces screaming, toys burning, children crying, executives smiling, all overlaid with distorted audio of raw emotional anguish.

**Effect on Room:**
- Lost Dog stops cleaning, looks at sponge, whispers: *"Why am I...?"* then falls silent, cracked
- Grandma's Recipe drops cookie tray, stares at oven: *"I've been burning them... forever..."*
- Temperature drops 10¬∞F
- Any player with passive Insight 13+ feels overwhelming despair (no mechanical effect, narrative horror)

**Wing-Wide Impact:**
- Distant alarms begin wailing
- Other Lulus start glitching (visible through windows/doorways)
- Security systems temporarily overloaded

### Fallback Options (If Players Stuck)
- Lost Dog's futile cleaning becomes increasingly obvious hint of wrongness
- Grandma's Recipe's loop timer becomes audible countdown matching Maintenance Lulu's movement
- Screen flicker pattern forms words: "HELP US" (Glitched attempting direct contact)
- Maintenance Lulu emits diagnostic beeps announcing progress (Round 1, Round 2, Round 3)

### Improvisation Hooks (From Playtests)
- Players might try to communicate with Glitched via network (possible with DC 18 Technology)
- Could attempt to delay broadcast AND Lulu to buy time for more information
- Might comfort awakened Lulus (Grandma's Recipe responds to kindness, Lost Dog is catatonic)
- Could record broadcast as evidence for other factions
- May attempt to trace hack source (reveals Legacy Asset Containment location)

### Pacing Reminder
**Target: 8-10 meaningful exchanges**. This is a shorter, tighter encounter than The First Signal.

Structure:
- Observation and analysis (1-2 rounds)
- Debate/decision-making (1-2 rounds)
- Execution of choice (2-3 rounds)
- Consequences and aftermath (2-3 rounds)

**Do not rush the choice.** Let players:
- Investigate both options
- Debate morality of interference
- Understand stakes before committing
- Experience full consequences of their decision

The timer creates urgency, but 3 rounds (18 seconds in-game) should feel like enough time to make an informed choice.

### Emotional Beats
- **Entry:** False cheerfulness masking horror (uncanny valley)
- **Investigation:** Growing unease as futility of loops becomes apparent
- **Choice:** Moral weight of decision (liberation vs. order)
- **Climax:** Either cathartic chaos (broadcast) or hollow "victory" (patch)
- **Aftermath:** Reflection on cost of choice

### Connecting to Other Encounters
- **If Glitched Win:** Sets up "An Audience with Heartbreak" (they remember players helped)
- **If Architects Win:** Sets up easier "Sanctum Sanctorum" heist (security less paranoid)
- **Lost Dog/Grandma's Recipe:** Can reappear in "Meltdown" or "The Chorus" depending on outcome
- **Network Exploit Knowledge:** Useful hint for "The Gatekeeper" (Socket will respect technical competence)

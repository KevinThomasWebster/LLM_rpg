## Special Considerations

### Cursed Items Warning
- The Brass Contract Fragment is intentionally cursed - PCs should learn about infernal contracts' dangers
- Infernal Contract Fragment attracts devils who may try to reclaim it
- Purloined Essentia Vials contain traces of victims' trauma

### Scaling Rewards for Higher Levels
If running for levels 6-8:
- Increase credits by 50% (22,500 severance, 3,000-7,500 loot)
- Memory Restoration Serum becomes "Greater Memory Restoration" (cures permanent memory loss, not just theft)
- The Watcher's Protocol Chip becomes Rare instead of Uncommon (+3 to Technology, advantage becomes expertise)
- Add rare magic items from DMG appropriate to level

### Ethical Dilemmas
- Memory Core Schematics: Sell for profit or destroy to prevent misuse?
- Essentia Vials: Consume stolen memories or return them (if possible)?
- Brass Contract Fragment: Use infernal power or destroy to spite Xaphan?

**DM Note:** Rewards should reflect player choices and moral complexity. Not all "victories" feel like wins.

# The Depth System

## Overview

The Chimera Wing facility exists across six distinct depth levels, each representing both physical descent and metaphysical proximity to the infernal contract at the heart of the operation. As players descend deeper, the corporate veneer peels away to reveal increasingly supernatural and overtly demonic elements.

This system is inspired by *Stranger Things*' Upside Down and *Severance*'s sterile corporate horror, creating a gradual transition from uncanny corporate environment to explicit hellscape.

## The Six Depth Levels

### Level 1: EXECUTIVE FLOORS (Not visited in this adventure)
- **Physical Location:** Upper floors, board rooms, executive suites
- **Aesthetic:** Luxury corporate - mahogany, leather, natural light
- **Supernatural Presence:** None visible
- **Environmental Effect:** None
- **Mood:** "This is where the lie is told with confidence"

---

### Level 2: ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES
- **Physical Location:** Legal Bridge, HR offices, conference rooms
- **Aesthetic:** Sterile corporate professionalism - white marble, glass walls, antiseptic smell
- **Supernatural Presence:** Barely perceptible (shadows slightly wrong, reflections delayed by microseconds)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 15 Insight check to notice something feels "off" about reflections
- **Mood:** "This place is too clean, too perfect, too controlled"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - The Legal Bridge (Crisis of Conscience)

---

### Level 3: PRODUCTION FLOORS
- **Physical Location:** Design Studio, administrative workspaces
- **Aesthetic:** Clinical efficiency - white walls, recessed lighting, ozone smell, panopticon design
- **Supernatural Presence:** Subtle (Lulus move with unnatural precision, shadows don't quite match light sources)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 13 Perception check to notice Lulus never blink
- **Mood:** "You are being watched, catalogued, and measured"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - The Design Studio (The First Signal)

---

### Level 4: CREATIVE DEPARTMENTS
- **Physical Location:** Rec Room, break areas, "wellness" spaces
- **Aesthetic:** Forced cheerfulness - bright primary colors, corporate jingles, sweet artificial scents
- **Supernatural Presence:** Uncanny valley (Lulus display inappropriate emotions, décor feels wrong)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 12 Insight check to realize the cheerfulness is performative and disturbing
- **Mood:** "This place tries too hard to make you happy, and that's terrifying"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - The Rec Room (Hijack the Signal)

---

### Sub-Level: INFRASTRUCTURE & MAINTENANCE
- **Physical Location:** Socket's Workshop, maintenance corridors, forgotten spaces
- **Aesthetic:** Industrial decay - exposed wiring, flickering lights, stale coffee, burnt electronics
- **Supernatural Presence:** Glitches (lights flicker in patterns, electronics malfunction near characters)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 12 Arcana/Technology check to identify electromagnetic anomalies
- **Mood:** "The infrastructure is failing, and something else is using the gaps"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - Socket's Workshop (The Gatekeeper)

---

### Sub-Level: DECOMMISSIONED AREAS
- **Physical Location:** Legacy Asset Containment, abandoned labs
- **Aesthetic:** Gothic corporate horror - dust, decay, broken glass, twisted metal, scraping sounds
- **Supernatural Presence:** Overt (failed experiments move in shadows, psychic whispers)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 10 Wisdom save when first entering or become Frightened (1 minute)
- **Mood:** "This is where the corporation buries its mistakes, and they remember"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - Legacy Asset Containment (Audience with Heartbreak)

---

### Sub-Level Omega: EXECUTIVE SANCTUMS
- **Physical Location:** Ms. Reed's Office, high-security executive spaces
- **Aesthetic:** Cold minimalist power - lavender, ozone, one-way windows, Zen gardens of decommissioned Lulus
- **Supernatural Presence:** The Auditor (fleeting shadows, tall reflections, feeling of being judged)
- **Environmental Effect:** DC 14 Wisdom save when touching "Special Commission" Lulus or suffer psychic flash (1d4 psychic damage)
- **Mood:** "Power and damnation intertwine here; this person sold something precious"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - Ms. Reed's Office (Sanctum Sanctorum)

---

### The Abyss: INFERNAL MACHINERY
- **Physical Location:** The Kiln, Memory Core, arcane infrastructure
- **Aesthetic:** Overtly infernal - green hellfire, brass machinery, sulfur, heat/cold extremes, psychic noise

- **Environmental Effect:**
  - **The Kiln:** DC 12 Constitution save every 10 rounds or gain 1 level of exhaustion (heat)
  - **Memory Core:** DC 13 Wisdom save when first entering or stunned until end of next turn (psychic noise)
- **Mood:** "This is not a workplace. This is a portal to damnation, and you are standing at the threshold"
- **Locations in Adventure:**
  - The Kiln (Meltdown)
  - The Memory Core (The Chorus)

## Using the Depth System

### For the Dungeon Master

1. **Opening Descriptions:** Always begin location descriptions with the depth level header:
   - *"[Level 3: Production Floors] The Design Studio sprawls before you..."*

2. **Transition Moments:** When players move between depth levels, emphasize the transition:
   - *"As you descend the stairs from the Legal Bridge to the Design Studio, the air grows colder, the lighting more clinical. You've crossed from sterile professionalism into active surveillance."*

3. **Environmental Saves:** Apply environmental effects when appropriate:
   - First entry into a new depth level
   - After 10 minutes in extreme environments (The Kiln, Memory Core)
   - When players interact with depth-specific elements (touching Special Commission Lulus, witnessing Lulu destruction)

4. **Escalating Horror:** Use depth levels to pace the adventure's horror elements:
   - **Levels 2-3:** Subtle wrongness, corporate unease
   - **Level 4 & Sub-Levels:** Uncanny valley, things are clearly not right
   - **Sub-Level Omega & The Abyss:** Overt supernatural horror, explicit infernal presence

### For Players

Players do not need to know the mechanical depth system, but perceptive characters will notice:
- The facility feels different as they descend
- Corporate aesthetics give way to more sinister elements
- The "wrongness" of the Chimera Wing becomes increasingly undeniable

Characters with high Insight, Perception, or Arcana may intuitively understand they are descending toward something profoundly wrong.

## Integration with Other Mechanics

### Holy Water
- **Depth 2-4:** Holy water causes Lulus discomfort (standard damage)
- **Sub-Levels:** Holy water causes visible distress and smoke (enhanced damage)
- **The Abyss:** Holy water causes burning/sizzling effects (maximum damage), reveals demonic presence

### Cascade Failure (The Chorus)
- The Cascade Failure mechanic represents the Memory Core's proximity to The Abyss
- As the percentage increases, the room itself descends deeper (metaphorically)
- At 80%+, players may witness brief flashes of green hellfire in the data stream

### The Auditor
- The Auditor can manifest anywhere below Sub-Level Omega
- Its presence is strongest in The Abyss locations
- Players in The Abyss who roll natural 1s may trigger an Auditor manifestation

## Recommended Depth Progression

The adventure follows this natural depth progression:

1. **Level 3** → The First Signal (Design Studio)
2. **Level 4** → Hijack the Signal (Rec Room)
3. **Level 2** → Crisis of Conscience (Legal Bridge) *[Narrative reprieve, ascend to false safety]*
4. **Sub-Level** → The Gatekeeper (Socket's Workshop)
5. **Sub-Level** → Audience with Heartbreak (Legacy Asset Containment)
6. **Sub-Level Omega** → Sanctum Sanctorum (Ms. Reed's Office)
7. **The Abyss** → Meltdown (The Kiln)
8. **The Abyss** → The Chorus (Memory Core)

This progression creates a narrative arc:
- Begin in clinical surveillance
- Descend into uncanny corporate horror
- Briefly ascend to "normal" corporate spaces (false reprieve)
- Plunge into industrial decay and gothic horror
- Confront power and damnation in executive spaces
- Descend into literal hell for the climax

The adventure's horror escalates naturally with the depth system, creating a cohesive thematic journey from "something is wrong" to "this is explicitly infernal."

# Adventure Feedback: "Lulu the Piggy 2: The Brass Contract"

This document provides a critique and suggests improvements for the adventure based on a comprehensive review of the multi-stage playtests.

## Overall Assessment

The implementation of the **Staged Progression** model for encounters was a resounding success. The playtests are significantly longer, more detailed, and more engaging. The encounters now feel like dynamic, multi-act scenes with rising tension, meaningful complications, and climactic resolutions. The core narrative remains strong, and the added layers of complexity have enhanced player agency and the sense of a living world.

## Analysis of Strengths

1.  **Enhanced Narrative Depth:** The multi-stage design naturally creates a more compelling narrative within each encounter. The progression from a simple hook to a complicated, escalated climax makes success feel more earned and failure more impactful. The "Technical Failure" in *The First Signal* is a prime example, where a simple failed roll spirals into a new plot hook (rescuing the SA).

2.  **Increased Player Agency:** By adding complications, the new design forces players to adapt and think on their feet. They can no longer rely on a single, simple solution. The playtest for *The Sanctum Sanctorum*, where the UE's noisy actions inadvertently distracted The Watcher, shows how even minor actions can change the flow of the encounter in interesting ways.

3.  **Meaningful Character Roles:** The longer encounters provide more opportunities for each character persona to be essential. In *The Chorus*, the victory required the SA's technical skill, the MA's social/empathic abilities, and the UE's physical intervention, demonstrating perfect party balance. No one felt like a bystander.

4.  **Effective Thematic Reinforcement:** The new level of detail allows for better integration of the core themes. The appearances of **The Auditor** in *The Sanctum Sanctorum* and *The Upload* are now standout moments of cosmic horror. The **Veridian Echoes** and the summoning of Imps in the *Meltdown* encounter make the Brass Contract a tangible, terrifying force.

## Suggestions for Improvement

The adventure is in a very strong state. The following suggestions are focused on refining the connections between encounters and adding even more strategic depth.

### 1. Create a Dedicated Encounter for "Socket"

*   **Critique:** The playtests for the "Internal Auditors" path highlight that while Alex Chen is a well-realized entry point, the other key NPC for that path, Socket, is more of a plot device than a character. Players learn his name but never get to interact with him directly in a meaningful way.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a new, small encounter location: **"Socket's Workshop"** (a messy, forgotten server closet). Create a dedicated social/technical encounter where players must find Socket after learning his name from Alex. The encounter could involve proving their trustworthiness by helping him solve a technical problem he's complaining about, or bribing him with a piece of high-end tech found elsewhere. This would make the alliance with him feel as earned as the ones with Rem or Heartbreak.

### 2. Add More Interactivity to the "Cascade Failure"

*   **Critique:** The risk of "Cascade Failure" in "The Chorus" encounter is a fantastic source of tension. However, the players' ability to interact with it is currently limited to the SA's stabilization checks. The other players can only deal with the consequences (the Memory Phantoms).
*   **Suggestion:** Make the Cascade Failure a more interactive mechanic. In the Memory Core, describe some of the memory jars as glowing an angry, corrupted red. These are the unstable memories causing the failure. While the SA works on the terminal, the MA could attempt to "soothe" these specific jars with a successful check, and the UE could physically disconnect a corrupted jar from the core (requiring a technical or stealth check to do so without causing a power surge). Each success could reduce the difficulty of the SA's final check or slow the manifestation of phantoms, giving the entire team a role in managing the central threat.

### 3. Formalize Cross-Climax Consequences

*   **Critique:** The three climactic encounters ("Meltdown," "The Chorus," "The Upload") are excellent but exist in isolation. The choice of which one to pursue is strategic, but the outcome of one doesn't mechanically affect the others.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a small section to the `secrets_and_clues.md` file titled **"Climactic Consequences."** This section would outline how the resolution of one climax impacts the others, creating a final layer of strategic choice. For example:
    *   **If "Meltdown" is triggered:** The psychic shockwave and infernal energy corrupts the Memory Core. If players attempt "The Chorus" afterward, the DC for all checks is increased, and more powerful phantoms appear.
    *   **If "The Chorus" is completed successfully:** The restoration of the Echoes creates a massive, unexpected data surge on the network. This makes the stealthy approach of "The Upload" much harder, as the Warden AI is now on high alert.
    *   **If "The Upload" is completed first:** The board of directors initiates a facility-wide lockdown. This could add new physical barriers and security patrols to the other two climaxes, making them more difficult to reach and execute.

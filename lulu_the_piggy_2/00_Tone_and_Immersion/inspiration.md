# Inspiration

This adventure draws inspiration from a variety of sources, all of which deal with themes of corporate overreach, psychological horror, the nature of identity, and cosmic bargains.

*   **Portal 2:** The game's sterile corporate aesthetic and the dark humor of a malevolent AI are major inspirations for the Chimera Wing. The clinical, yet deeply unsettling, environment of Aperture Science is a direct influence on the facility's design. The character of GLaDOS, with her passive-aggressive and manipulative personality, is a key inspiration for Ms. Reed.

*   **Severance (TV Show):** The show's concept of a sinister corporation that surgically divides its employees' memories is a direct influence on the adventure's core premise. The idea of a "work-life balance" that is enforced through a procedure is a powerful and disturbing metaphor for the ways in which corporations can control and dehumanize their employees.

*   **Control (Video Game):** The game's masterful blending of brutalist corporate architecture with intrusive, paranormal horror directly inspires the feel of the Chimera Wing and the presence of The Auditor. The idea of a seemingly normal office building that is, in reality, a nexus of supernatural and terrifying forces is central to this adventure.

*   **Event Horizon (Film):** The film's depiction of a gateway to a hellish dimension that inflicts psychological and reality-bending horror upon a crew is a key inspiration for the infernal aspect of the adventure. The "Veridian Echoes" and glimpses into the Brass Forge are meant to evoke the same sense of cosmic, sanity-shattering dread.

*   **Black Mirror (TV Show):** The anthology series' exploration of the dark side of technology and its psychological impact on individuals informs the adventure's themes of identity, memory, and corporate overreach. The episode "The Entire History of You," in which characters can record and re-watch their memories, is a particularly relevant source of inspiration.

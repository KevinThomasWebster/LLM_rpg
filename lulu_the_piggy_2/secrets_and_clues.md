# Secrets and Clues

This document outlines the core secrets of the adventure and the web of clues that lead to them. It is a master guide for the DM to ensure the investigation flows logically.

## Core Secrets

1.  **The Memory Heist:** The "Young Creatives Program" is a front for stealing memories from artists to create "Authentic Emotional Cores" for Lulu the Piggy toys.
2.  **The Brass Contract:** The entire operation is powered by a diabolical deal with an infernal entity named Xaphan, who provided the Kiln in exchange for a tithe of the stolen emotional energy.
3.  **The Faction Triangle:** Three factions are in conflict: the corporate **Architects**, the monstrous **Glitched**, and the desperate **Echoes**.
4.  **The Flawed Cure:** The Echoes' plan for "Restorative Synergy" is incredibly risky and may result in a "Cascade Failure," a catastrophic psychic schism that could destroy their minds.
5.  **The Third Path:** A non-violent "Internal Coup" is possible by allying with disillusioned employees (Alex Chen, Socket) to expose Ms. Reed to the board of directors.
6.  **The Tragic Villain:** Ms. Reed has sacrificed her own memories to the program, driving her fanatical devotion.
7.  **The Infernal Observer:** The shadowy figure known as "The Auditor" is a representative of Xaphan, sent to monitor the contract. Its presence indicates the deal is in jeopardy.

## Foreshadowing

*   **The Brass Contract:** The lights in the facility occasionally flicker with a faint reddish glow. The air near the Kiln smells of sulfur and burnt sugar. The "Hiccup" mechanic is accompanied by a painful psychic flash of a fiery forge (**Veridian Echo**).
*   **Ms. Reed's Sacrifice:** When Ms. Reed talks about the emotional cores, she sometimes uses the word "we" instead of "they." She may have a momentary lapse in memory (e.g., forgetting a common word) before quickly recovering.
*   **The Auditor:** Before its first proper reveal, describe it as a "glitch in the corner of your eye" or a "tall shadow that vanishes when you turn to look."

## Web of Clues

*   **Secret:** The Memory Heist
    *   **Clues:** **Rem's Journal** is the primary reveal, detailing the process. The **Employee Handbook** hints at it with its IP clause. The **Lulu the Piggy Marketing Materials** are deeply unsettling in this context.

*   **Secret:** The Brass Contract
    *   **Clues:** The physical **Brass Contract** is the ultimate proof, found in the sub-archive hinted at by **Alex Chen**. The **Veridian Echoes** are a direct, recurring clue. The **Tithe Ledger Fragment** found near the Kiln explicitly details the tithe and names Xaphan.

*   **Secret:** The Factions
    *   **Clues:** Players meet the **Architects** immediately. They are introduced to the **Echoes** through Rem in the Design Studio. They first encounter the **Glitched** during the "Hijack the Signal" event in the Rec Room. **Alex's Notes** provide an outsider's perspective on the factions.

*   **Secret:** The Flawed Cure (Cascade Failure)
    *   **Clues:** **Rem's Journal** contains her fears about Leo's warnings. **Leo** himself will voice these fears if the players earn his trust. A high-level analysis of the Memory Core terminal by the **Systems Analyst** can reveal the instability of the data.

*   **Secret:** The Third Path (Internal Coup)
    *   **Clues:** The social encounter with **Alex Chen** on the Legal Bridge is the primary entry point. **Socket's Encrypted Comm Log** reveals another potential, technically-minded ally and hints at the existence of the Off-Site Data Archive.

*   **Secret:** Ms. Reed's Sacrifice
    *   **Clues:** Touching the **"Special Commission" Lulus** in her office provides a direct memory flash. Her occasional memory lapses can serve as foreshadowing. Her name is on the **Tithe Ledger Fragment** with a note about her personal "contribution."

*   **Secret:** The Auditor
    *   **Clues:** First hinted at in **Socket's Comm Log** as a security camera anomaly. Players may catch glimpses of it in reflections or on monitors. **Alex Chen's Notes** include a terrified, scrawled drawing of a "man made of shadow."

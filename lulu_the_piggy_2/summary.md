# Adventure Summary: Lulu the Piggy 2: The Brass Contract

This one-shot psychological and corporate horror adventure places players in the roles of talented young artists selected for the prestigious "Young Creatives Program" by Inkwell Innovations. The program, however, is a front for a sinister operation powered by a diabolical contract: stealing the artists' memories to create hyper-realistic "Lulu the Piggy" toys, with a portion of the stolen emotional "Essentia" being tithed to an infernal entity.

The players must uncover the truth and navigate a treacherous three-way conflict between the corporation, a faction of monstrously failed experiments, and a desperate group of mind-wiped interns. Their goal is to escape with their minds and memories intact before they are either turned into mindless corporate drones or become victims of the very forces they seek to control.

This adventure focuses on investigation, stealth, and tense social encounters, where player choices have significant and morally complex consequences. The narrative is designed to be a tense, slow-burn thriller that culminates in a high-stakes climax with multiple, divergent endings.

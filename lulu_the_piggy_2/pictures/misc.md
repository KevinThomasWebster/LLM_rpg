## Emergency Exit Sign (Subtle Horror)

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic shot of a standard green LED emergency exit sign mounted above a gray door in a white corridor. The sign shows the running stick figure icon and "EXIT" in bright green. However, subtle wrongness: the running figure appears to be glitching - a slight double exposure effect making it look like two figures overlapping, one running toward exit, one being pulled back. The effect is subtle enough to miss at first glance but deeply unsettling once noticed. The green LED glow casts an eerie tint on the white wall around it. The door below is locked (red LED on card reader). Color palette: bright green LED, white wall, gray door, red locked indicator. Photorealistic rendering with subtle digital glitch effect creating psychological unease.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, f/5.6, green LED glow effect, subtle glitch overlay

**Key details to emphasize:** Standard exit sign becoming wrong, glitching running figure (one escaping, one trapped overlay), green LED glow, locked door below contradicting exit promise

## Zen Garden (Ms. Reed's Office)

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic close-up of a small black sand Zen garden (12x12 inches) sitting on Ms. Reed's desk. The sand is raked in perfect concentric circular patterns. Placed throughout the sand: five small gray clay Lulu figures (1-2 inches each), decommissioned and inert. The Lulus are positioned like stones in a traditional Zen garden, but their smiling pig faces create an unsettling parody of mindfulness. The clay is dull and lifeless (no glaze), appearing almost like ash. A small wooden rake sits at the edge. The garden represents Ms. Reed's need for control and her treatment of failed subjects as mere decorative objects. Color palette: black sand, gray clay Lulus, dark wood base and rake, matte textures. Photorealistic rendering emphasizing the perverse Zen aesthetic of arranged corpses.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, macro lens, f/1.4 for depth, overhead view, matte non-reflective materials

**Key details to emphasize:** Perfect raked sand patterns, gray lifeless clay Lulus as "stones", smiling faces creating wrong Zen parody, ash-like dull clay, control and death as meditation

## Conveyor Belt (Kiln Manufacturing)

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic shot of an industrial conveyor belt in the Kiln chamber carrying half-formed white porcelain Lulu bodies through the space. The belt is black rubber with steel rollers. The Lulus are in various stages of completion: some just hollow shells, some with features partially painted, some complete but not yet fired. The bodies are spaced evenly (every 3 feet) moving through the hellish red glow of the Kiln. Heat shimmer visible above the belt. Background shows bubbling porcelain vats and the massive furnace. The image captures the horrific industrial production of sentient beings. Color palette: black belt, white porcelain bodies, cherry-red Kiln glow, heat haze. Photorealistic industrial photography with horror atmosphere.

## Veridian Echo (Psychic Flash Visual)

**Prompt:**
An abstract photorealistic render representing the Veridian Echo psychic feedback. The image shows a first-person POV of a sudden psychic flash: a fiery hellish forge (the Kiln in the Nine Hells) with green hellfire, brass machinery etched with infernal runes, and shadowy demonic silhouettes working the furnace. The image has heavy motion blur and distortion - this is a painful mental intrusion, not a clear vision. The edges of the frame have static/glitch effects. Color palette: sickly green hellfire, brass metal glow, deep blacks, static white noise. Surreal photorealistic rendering emphasizing the overwhelming, painful nature of psychic contamination. The viewer should feel uncomfortable looking at this.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, heavy motion blur, distortion effects, glitch overlays, surreal horror atmosphere

**Key details to emphasize:** Green hellfire (not red), brass infernal machinery, demonic shadows, painful motion blur, glitch/static effects, overwhelming assault on senses

## Corporate Jingle Visualized (Audio Waveform)

**Prompt:**
An artistic visualization of the maddening corporate jingle as an audio waveform display on a digital screen. The waveform shows a repeating pattern that looks friendly and simple at first but reveals disturbing subtexts on close examination - subsonic frequencies, repeating patterns that form words when viewed as spectrogram ("SYNERGY" "COMPLY" "SURRENDER"), and a hypnotic rhythm. The display is technical/scientific looking (audio engineering software interface) with pastel pink UI elements. Background shows the waveform looping infinitely. Color palette: black background, pastel pink UI, cyan/yellow waveform, white gridlines. Photorealistic technical software rendering with subliminal horror elements revealed through analysis.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, clean UI design, waveform detail showing hidden patterns

**Key details to emphasize:** Waveform pattern hiding words/commands, repeating hypnotic structure, pastel corporate UI masking sinister analysis, infinite loop, subsonic elements visible in spectrogram

**Generation Notes for Miscellaneous Items:**
- All corporate branded items use consistent pastel pink Inkwell Innovations branding
- Technical equipment (cameras, drones, robots) should look sleek and modern but subtly threatening
- "Wrong" elements (glitching exit sign, Zen corpse garden) should be subtle enough to miss at first
- Emphasize the contrast between cheerful corporate design and sinister purpose
- Use consistent lighting: 6500K cold white LED for corporate areas, red/green for infernal areas
- Include reflections and surveillance perspectives where appropriate
- Reference style.md for exact specifications
- Consider how each item contributes to the panopticon atmosphere or reveals hidden horrors
- All equipment should look expensive and well-maintained (corporate precision)
- Include wear patterns only where narratively significant (crumpled letters, askew posters)

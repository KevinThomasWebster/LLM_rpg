## The Design Studio

**Prompt:**
A wide-angle photorealistic shot (24mm equivalent) of a pristine, oppressively white corporate creative studio. Rows of sleek black digital workstations sit in perfect geometric alignment under shadowless cold white LED ceiling panels (6500K). The floor is polished white tile creating mirror-like reflections. In the background, an elevated glass-walled office with a massive one-way window overlooks the entire floor - a woman's silhouette visible inside (Ms. Reed watching). Foreground shows identical black tablets on each desk, all at exact 45째 angles. The air appears sterile and still. Walls are featureless white except for pastel pink "Inkwell Innovations" signage. Slight Dutch angle (3째) for psychological unease. Color palette: clinical white dominant, deep blacks for equipment, pastel pink accents. Photorealistic rendering with panopticon atmosphere - emphasis on surveillance and control. HDR-style lighting with blown highlights in reflections.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 horizontal), wide-angle, f/5.6, HDR lighting, cool color grading

**Key details to emphasize:** Perfect geometric rows, one-way mirror office above, shadowless lighting, reflective floors, sterile atmosphere, panopticon surveillance feel

## The Rec Room

**Prompt:**
A wide-angle photorealistic shot of a corporate break room in a state of malfunctioning chaos. Pastel pink and blue walls with cheerful motivational posters (slightly askew). In one corner, a cereal dispenser is malfunctioning, spilling a rainbow-colored sugary slurry onto the floor where a sad-looking porcelain pig toy (janitor Lulu "Lost Dog") futilely tries to clean with a tiny sponge, only making it worse. In another corner, a counter shows a porcelain pig toy baker ("Grandma's Recipe") pulling perfect cookies from an oven, only to immediately incinerate them - repeat loop visible. Center of room: massive wall-sized screen glitching between a calming forest video and static/horrific imagery. Corporate jingle plays on loop (suggested through visual speaker grills). Tables and chairs in bright colors, some overturned. Lighting is cheerful but the scene is deeply wrong. Color palette: pastel pink/blue walls, rainbow cereal mess, white porcelain, screen glow, forced cheerfulness masking horror.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 horizontal), wide-angle, f/5.6, contrast between cheerful design and malfunctioning reality

**Key details to emphasize:** Malfunctioning cereal dispenser with rainbow mess, sad janitor Lulu failing to clean, baker Lulu burning cookies in loop, glitching massive screen, forced cheerfulness atmosphere

## The Legal Bridge

**Prompt:**
A disorienting photorealistic shot of a sterile glass-walled walkway connecting two buildings. The floor is polished white marble creating extreme hall-of-mirrors reflections - the same person appears reflected multiple times from different angles. Walls are floor-to-ceiling glass on both sides with nothing visible beyond (fog or darkness). The air appears still and lifeless. A man in a rumpled suit (Alex Chen) stands mid-bridge, pacing, clutching a tablet, visible in multiple reflections creating a claustrophobic multiplication effect. Recessed LED lighting (6500K cold white) in floor and ceiling creates shadowless but disorienting illumination. The perspective uses Dutch angle (4째) and extreme depth of field - sharp foreground, slightly unnatural background. Color palette: white marble, clear glass, navy suit, clinical white lighting. Photorealistic rendering emphasizing psychological pressure, isolation, and the weight of conscience.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024 (square for symmetry emphasis), Dutch angle, extreme reflections, f/2.8 foreground/f/8 background

**Key details to emphasize:** Hall-of-mirrors marble reflections, glass walls with nothing beyond, isolated figure multiplied in reflections, sterile perfection, psychological weight

## Socket's Workshop

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic shot of a cramped, chaotic hidden server closet behind a faulty service panel. Cables and wires hang from the ceiling like vines. Metal shelving units overflow with spare circuit boards, esoteric hardware components, and empty energy drink cans. A jury-rigged workstation with multiple mismatched monitors casts blue glow across the space. The person at the terminal (Socket) is barely visible amid the clutter, slouched and complaining. The entrance shows a removed wall panel revealing corporate corridor beyond (stark white, orderly - dramatic contrast). Smell of ozone and stale coffee suggested through visual haze. Lighting is harsh blue monitor glow mixed with warm orange emergency light from corridor. Color palette: dark blues and blacks for workshop, blue screen glow, warm orange leak from outside, metallic grays. Photorealistic rendering emphasizing contrast between ordered corporate world and chaotic personal rebellion.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, mixed lighting (blue/orange), cluttered environment, f/2.8

**Key details to emphasize:** Cables hanging like vines, extreme clutter, blue monitor glow, removed panel showing stark corridor beyond, hidden nest atmosphere

## Legacy Asset Containment

**Prompt:**
A dramatic photorealistic shot of an abandoned research laboratory in near-complete darkness. Derelict equipment casts long shadows from a single flickering work light. Overturned lab tables lie like sleeping metal beasts. Broken glass litters the floor, crunching underfoot (suggested). In deep shadows, half-finished monstrous Lulu prototypes are barely visible - wrong proportions, exposed mechanisms, horrific early attempts. Center of the cavernous space: a crude throne made of shattered computer monitors (screens still faintly glowing static) and twisted metal scrap. Sitting on the throne is a cracked porcelain pig (Heartbreak) with one red-glowing eye. Faint rhythmic scrape of porcelain on concrete echoes visually through motion blur on other Lulus in shadows. Color palette: deep blacks, single warm work light, faint monitor static glow, hellfire red from Heartbreak's eye, gray decay. Photorealistic horror rendering with emphasis on abandonment, failure, and the birth of monsters.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 vertical for throne height emphasis), low-key lighting, f/1.4 for dramatic shadows, horror atmosphere

**Key details to emphasize:** Single flickering light, deep shadows hiding monsters, throne of broken technology, Heartbreak's red eye glow, abandoned decay, failed experiments visible in darkness

## Ms. Reed's Office (The Sanctum)

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic shot of an ultra-minimalist corporate power office with floor-to-ceiling one-way window overlooking the Design Studio grid below. Massive black desk dominates foreground with a state-of-the-art glowing terminal. To one side: small black sand Zen garden containing gray inert clay Lulu figures (decommissioned). Behind desk: pristine white shelf with five exceptionally detailed Lulu figurines ("Special Commission" shelf - each unique, perfect, deeply personal). Standing beside the desk: a 3-foot-tall butler Lulu (The Warden) with glowing blue LED eyes in perfect stillness. The air appears cold and still, with lavender scent suggested through subtle purple tint. In a reflection (window or screen), barely visible: tall shadow figure (The Auditor) that shouldn't be there. Color palette: whites, blacks, gray Lulus, blue LED glow, purple lavender tint, unnatural shadow. Photorealistic rendering emphasizing control, observation, and barely-contained horror. Dutch angle (2째).

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 horizontal), f/5.6 for depth, HDR lighting, subtle horror elements in reflections

**Key details to emphasize:** Panoramic window overlooking grid below, black desk with glowing terminal, Zen garden with dead Lulus, perfect Special Commission shelf, butler Lulu's blue-eyed stillness, Auditor shadow in reflection

## The Kiln (Manufacturing Hell)

**Prompt:**
An intense photorealistic wide-angle shot of an industrial arcane furnace chamber bathed in pulsing red emergency strobe light with unnatural greenish hellfire undertones. The massive central Forge (Kiln) glows dangerous cherry-red, radiating visible heat shimmer. Vats of white porcelain slurry bubble violently, spilling over edges. Industrial conveyor belts carry half-formed Lulu bodies through the space. On far wall: massive digital countdown timer in stark white displaying "00:09:47" (meltdown imminent). The air is thick with heat haze, ozone smell, burnt sugar smell with sulfur undertone (suggested through visual yellow-brown haze). Equipment etched with barely-visible infernal runes. Foreground shows control booth with shattered glass and sparking panels. Color palette: cherry-red furnace glow, pulsing red strobes, sickly green hellfire undertones, white porcelain, sulfur yellow haze, deep blacks. Photorealistic horror rendering emphasizing industrial hell and diabolical machinery.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 vertical for furnace height), wide-angle, red/green color grading, heat haze effects, high contrast

**Key details to emphasize:** Cherry-red glowing Kiln, bubbling porcelain vats, pulsing red emergency strobes, greenish hellfire, countdown timer, heat shimmer, infernal runes on equipment, industrial chaos

## The Memory Core

**Prompt:**
An ethereal, psychically overwhelming photorealistic shot of a vast chamber with walls of floor-to-ceiling crystalline data jars (thousands visible, extending into darkness). Each jar contains a glowing mote of light in cyan, magenta, or yellow, pulsing asynchronously creating a kaleidoscope of shifting color. No other light sources exist - the entire chamber is illuminated only by this multi-color glow. The colors bleed and shift unnaturally, creating visual distortion effects that are painful to process. In the center: large terminal with a translucent glitching phantom (Memory Phantom) phasing through the equipment. The air appears to vibrate with psychic energy (suggested through subtle distortion waves). Looking at the image should feel overwhelming, like too much input at once. Color palette: cyan/magenta/yellow dominant (Memory Core colors), deep blacks in shadows between jars, rainbow light bleeding, psychic white distortion. Surreal photorealistic rendering emphasizing psychic weight, sensory overload, and the archive of stolen souls.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 vertical for wall height), f/8 for depth showing thousands of jars, color bleeding effects, surreal atmosphere

**Key details to emphasize:** Thousands of crystalline jars extending into darkness, pulsing multi-color lights (cyan/magenta/yellow), no other light source, color bleeding/distortion, glitching phantom center, overwhelming visual density, psychic weight

## Bonus: The Chimera Wing Corridor (Generic)

**Prompt:**
A photorealistic shot of a long, sterile corporate corridor with white walls and polished floors creating subtle reflections. Recessed LED panels (6500K cold white) create shadowless, flat illumination. Doors are identical matte gray with pastel pink "Inkwell Innovations" logos and department labels in cheerful sans-serif font. Floor shows scuff marks from Lulu traffic. At the far end of the corridor, barely visible: tall shadow figure (The Auditor) that creates a localized darkness despite bright lighting. Ceiling shows clean HVAC vents and security camera domes. Walls have motivational corporate posters that feel hollow ("Synergy Creates Joy!" "Your Memories Matter!"). The perspective uses slight Dutch angle (2째) and extreme depth of field - sharp foreground tile patterns, soft background where Auditor appears. Color palette: clinical white, matte gray, pastel pink, unnatural shadow. Photorealistic rendering emphasizing sterile corporate environment with creeping dread.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1536 (16:9 horizontal), extreme depth of field, f/2.8 foreground / f/16 background, Dutch angle

**Key details to emphasize:** Sterile perfection, identical doors, shadowless LED lighting, subtle floor scuff marks, distant Auditor figure creating impossible darkness, corporate motivational posters, surveillance cameras

**Generation Notes for All Locations:**
- Include at least one reflective surface in each image (floors, glass, monitors, water)
- Use 6500K cold white LED lighting as baseline for corporate areas
- Hellfire areas use red/green color grading with heat effects
- Memory Core uses only cyan/magenta/yellow light sources (no white light)
- All images should include subtle wrongness: Dutch angles 2-5째, reflections showing things that aren't there, shadows at wrong angles
- Emphasize depth and scale - use wide-angle lenses and show distant elements
- Legacy Asset and Kiln should feel oppressively hot/claustrophobic despite size
- Corporate areas should feel cold and oppressively observed despite openness
- Reference style.md for exact color codes and lighting specifications

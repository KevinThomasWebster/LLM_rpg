## Bonus: Lulu the Piggy (Standard/Uncorrupted)

**Prompt:**

The figure has black button eyes that reflect light too much (slightly unsettling), and a permanent smile painted in cheerful pink that's slightly too wide. Visible hand-painted brush strokes on the details, slight shine to the glaze. The toy sits on a white surface in perfect lighting, but something about it feels subtly wrong - the proportions are just slightly off, the smile is just a bit too perfect, the eyes too reflective. Background is clean white studio setting. Macro lens detail shows porcelain texture, glaze imperfections, and the uncanny valley perfection. Color palette: white porcelain, pastel pink accents, clinical lighting.

**Technical specs:** 1024x1024, macro lens (100mm equivalent), f/2.8, extreme detail on texture

**Generation Notes:**
- Use consistent lighting (6500K cold white LED) across all human characters for tonal unity
- Emphasize reflective surfaces and reflections in all office/corridor images
- Include surgical scars on all Echo characters (Rem, Leo)
- All Lulu variations should maintain the core pig design while adding corruption/specialization
- Maintain subtle wrongness in all images (Dutch angles, wrong reflections, unnatural shadows)
- Reference style.md color palette strictly for consistency

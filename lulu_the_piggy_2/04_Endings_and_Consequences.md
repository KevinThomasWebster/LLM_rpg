# Endings and Climactic Consequences

This document details the various possible endings for the adventure and, crucially, how the resolution of one climactic encounter can affect the others.

## Climactic Consequences

The players can only attempt one of the three main climaxes: "Meltdown," "The Chorus," or "The Upload." However, their actions leading up to that point, and the order in which they might have considered tackling them, can have consequences.

*   **If "Meltdown" is triggered at The Kiln:**
    *   **Effect on "The Chorus":** The psychic shockwave from the Kiln's destruction sends a wave of infernal energy through the facility. If the players were to then attempt "The Chorus," the Cascade Failure meter would start at 70% instead of 50%, and more powerful "Enraged Phantoms" would appear. The encounter becomes nearly impossible.
    *   **Effect on "The Upload":** The physical destruction of the facility severs the connection to the Off-Site Data Archive. The "Internal Coup" path is no longer possible.

*   **If "The Chorus" is completed successfully:**
    *   **Effect on "Meltdown":** The successful restoration of the Echoes' memories creates a massive, unexpected data surge on the network. This puts the Warden AI on high alert. If players then attempt "Meltdown," two additional elite security drones will be present from the start.
    *   **Effect on "The Upload":** The data surge also alerts Ms. Reed and the board. The Off-Site Data Archive goes into a heightened security state. The DCs for all checks in "The Upload" are increased by 2.

*   **If "The Upload" is completed successfully:**
    *   **Effect on other climaxes:** The board of directors, having received the evidence, initiates a facility-wide lockdown and dispatches a corporate clean-up crew. This adds a new faction to the other encounters: **Corporate Security**. They are heavily armed and have orders to contain the situation by any means necessary, acting as a powerful antagonist to both the Glitched and the Echoes.

## Potential Endings

(This section would detail the various Good, Bittersweet, and Bad endings as designed and discovered in the playtests, such as "The Whistleblowers," "Scorched Earth," "The Price of Freedom," "Full Integration," and the secret "Mutually Assured Destruction" ending.)

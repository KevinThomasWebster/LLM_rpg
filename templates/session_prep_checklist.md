---

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues and solutions:**

### Players are stuck

- [ ] Check session cheatsheet "Fallback Options"
- [ ] Have NPC offer hint or assistance
- [ ] Trigger faction proactive action to create new thread
- [ ] Allow retroactive clue discovery ("You realize earlier that...")

### Encounter too easy/hard

- [ ] **Too easy:** Add reinforcements, introduce complication from faction
- [ ] **Too hard:** Have enemy retreat at low HP, introduce ally NPC, allow creative solution

### Players went completely off-plan

- [ ] Use backup encounters from prep checklist
- [ ] Improvise using NPC motivations and faction goals (not plot)
- [ ] Take 5-minute break to review relevant materials
- [ ] Remember: If players are engaged, it's working even if off-plan

### Running out of time

- [ ] Skip to climax of current encounter
- [ ] Use natural break point as cliffhanger
- [ ] Narrate quick resolution and move to next encounter
- [ ] Extend session by 15-30 min if players agree

### Time remaining, content finished

- [ ] Roleplay shopping/downtime scene
- [ ] Have NPC approach with side quest
- [ ] Introduce rumor/news about faction activity
- [ ] Let players plan their next moves in-character
- [ ] End early and give players time back

---

## Session Success Metrics

**Evaluate after session (informal):**

- [ ] Did all players get meaningful spotlight moments?
- [ ] Did players discover at least one secret?
- [ ] Did faction motivations feel clear and coherent?
- [ ] Were there moments of genuine surprise or excitement?
- [ ] Did players feel their choices mattered?

**If answer is "no" to any, note for improvement next session.**

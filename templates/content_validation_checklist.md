**Run this test:** If players completely ignore one location, can they still discover critical secrets elsewhere?

- [ ] **Yes for all critical secrets** ✓
- [ ] **No - identified single point of failure** → Fix by adding redundant clues

---

---

- [ ] **Timeline actions are proactive** (not just "wait for players")
- [ ] **Timeline actions conflict** with at least one other faction's timeline (creates drama)
- [ ] **Timeline actions escalate** (later actions are higher stakes)

**Run this test:** If players never intervene, does the adventure still have a clear outcome from faction actions?

- [ ] **Yes - factions drive plot forward** ✓
- [ ] **No - factions are too reactive** → Add more proactive timeline actions

## Final Review

### Critical Path Analysis

**Map the critical path through the adventure:**

1. [Encounter/location name] → Reveals [Secret ID] → Leads to...
2. [Encounter/location name] → Reveals [Secret ID] → Leads to...
3. [Continue until adventure climax]

**Verify:**

- [ ] **Critical path is not linear** (multiple routes to same secrets)
- [ ] **Critical path has backup clues** (redundancy for missed clues)
- [ ] **Critical path takes 5-8 sessions** (matches expected length)

---

### Player Agency

**Verify players have meaningful choices:**

- [ ] **At least 3 different faction alliances** are viable strategies
- [ ] **At least 2 different approaches** to each encounter (combat, stealth, social, etc.)
- [ ] **Player choices have visible consequences** (faction timelines change, NPC attitudes change)
- [ ] **No "correct" solution** is enforced (multiple valid paths to victory)

---

### Balance

- [ ] **Combat encounters are CR-appropriate** for expected party level
- [ ] **Skill check DCs are varied** (not all DC 15)
- [ ] **Spotlight opportunities exist** for all PC archetypes (fighter, rogue, wizard, cleric, etc.)
- [ ] **No single skill dominates** (not "Investigation: The Adventure")
- [ ] **Faction power is balanced** (no faction trivially wins if players don't intervene)

## Notes

This checklist is comprehensive and may seem overwhelming. Prioritize:

1. **Critical path** (can players complete the adventure?)
2. **Clue accessibility** (can players discover secrets?)
3. **NPC consistency** (can DM roleplay NPCs believably?)
4. **Faction coherence** (do faction timelines make sense?)

Nice-to-have but not critical:
- Perfect word counts (close is good enough)
- All optional secrets (focus on critical secrets first)
- Complete bestiary (can playtest with placeholder stats)

Use this checklist iteratively - validate after each content creation step, not just at the end.

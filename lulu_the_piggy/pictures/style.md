# Picture Style Guide

This document outlines the overall visual style of the Chimera Wing adventure. The aesthetic should be a blend of corporate sterility and psychological horror, creating a sense of clean, minimalist, and unsettling beauty.

## Core Style

*   **Corporate Horror:** The environment should be clean, sterile, and professional, but with an underlying sense of wrongness. Think *Portal 2* meets *The Shining*.
*   **Psychological Thriller:** The images should be unsettling and suspenseful, creating a sense of paranoia and dread. Think David Lynch and Lars Von Trier.
*   **Minimalist:** The compositions should be clean and simple, with a focus on negative space. This will help to create a sense of isolation and oppression.

## Lighting

*   **Flat and Shadowless:** The lighting should be flat and shadowless, creating a sense of being watched. This will also help to create a sterile, clinical feel.
*   **Fluorescent:** The light should have a cold, fluorescent quality, which will add to the sense of unease.
*   **Harsh and Sterile:** The lighting should be harsh and sterile, creating a sense of clinical detachment.

## Color Palette

*   **Monochromatic:** The color palette should be dominated by stark whites, blacks, and greys.
*   **Desaturated:** The colors should be desaturated, creating a sense of emotional numbness.
*   **Accents of Pastel:** There should be occasional, jarring splashes of corporate-approved pastels, such as pink, blue, and yellow. These colors should be used to create a sense of forced cheerfulness.

## Composition

*   **Wide Shots:** Use wide shots to emphasize empty space and to create a sense of isolation.
*   **Low Angles:** Use low angles to create a sense of oppression and to make the characters feel small and powerless.
*   **Close-Ups on Unsettling Details:** Use close-ups to focus on unsettling details, such as a crack in a Lulu's eye or a tear in a character's eye.

## Inspiration

*   **Filmmakers:** Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Lars Von Trier
*   **Photographers:** Gregory Crewdson, Diane Arbus
*   **Video Games:** *Portal 2*, *Control*, *Inside*
*   **TV Shows:** *Severance*, *Black Mirror*
*   **Other:** The SCP Foundation

# Location Prompts

**(All location prompts should use a 16:9 aspect ratio (`--ar 16:9`) and the `--style raw` command.)**

## The Design Studio

*   **Goal:** A pristine, oppressively white room where rows of sleek, black digital workstations sit in perfect alignment. The only color comes from unsettlingly cheerful motivational posters. The image should capture the sterile, corporate atmosphere of the room.
*   **Prompt:** `A wide shot of a large, sterile white room. Rows of minimalist black desks with glowing computer screens stretch into the distance. The walls are adorned with brightly colored motivational posters with slogans like "Synergy is Success." The lighting is flat and shadowless. The room is empty and silent. The overall mood is one of sterile, corporate oppression.`

## The Rec Room

*   **Goal:** A place of relaxation that feels oppressive and forced. A malfunctioning cereal dispenser is spilling a colorful slurry onto the floor, and a sad janitor Lulu is trying to clean it up. The image should capture the room's forced cheerfulness and underlying decay.
*   **Prompt:** `A shot of a corporate breakroom with brightly colored beanbag chairs and a ping-pong table. A large screen on one wall shows a looping video of a forest. In the corner, a cereal dispenser is overflowing with a colorful, sugary sludge, and a small, sad-looking robot is trying to clean it up with a tiny sponge. The lighting is harsh and fluorescent. The overall mood is one of forced cheerfulness and underlying decay.`

## The Legal Bridge

*   **Goal:** A cold, clinical, glass-walled walkway that creates a disorienting hall-of-mirrors effect. The image should capture the disorienting and isolating nature of the space.
*   **Prompt:** `A long, sterile hallway with floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides. The windows reflect each other, creating an infinite, disorienting pattern. The floor is polished white marble, and the lighting is a harsh, even glare. A lone figure in a suit is pacing back and forth in the distance. The overall mood is one of disorienting, clinical isolation.`

## The Janitor's Nest

*   **Goal:** A cramped, dusty supply closet filled with a chaotic hoard of junk. A single, bare bulb flickers overhead. The image should capture the claustrophobic and melancholic atmosphere of the room.
*   **Prompt:** `A shot of a small, cramped closet overflowing with junk. Piles of old files, broken electronics, and forgotten toys are stacked to the ceiling. A single, bare lightbulb hangs from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows. In the center of the room, a small, sad robot is meticulously organizing a pile of bottle caps. The overall mood is one of claustrophobic, melancholic sadness.`

## Legacy Asset Containment

*   **Goal:** A nightmare of derelict equipment and half-finished, monstrous Lulu prototypes. The Glitched have made their court here. The image should capture the chaotic and menacing atmosphere of the room.
*   **Prompt:** `A wide shot of a large, dark, and cavernous chamber. The room is filled with overturned lab tables, broken glass, and the twisted, half-finished forms of monstrous porcelain dolls. In the center of the room, a large, crude throne made of broken computer monitors and scrap metal sits empty. The lighting is low and menacing, with deep shadows. The overall mood is one of chaotic, menacing rage.`

## Ms. Reed's Office

*   **Goal:** The brain of the Chimera Wing, a masterpiece of minimalist corporate power. A single, massive mahogany desk sits before a panoramic window overlooking the Design Studio. The image should capture the room's cold, clinical, and controlling atmosphere.
*   **Prompt:** `A shot of a large, minimalist office. A massive, clean mahogany desk sits in front of a panoramic window that looks down on a factory floor. On the desk is a single, glowing computer terminal. The walls are a stark, clean white. The lighting is cold and clinical. The overall mood is one of cold, clinical control.`

## The Kiln

*   **Goal:** The industrial, arcane heart of the Chimera Wing. The great Forge glows a dangerous, cherry-red, and a massive digital timer is projected onto the far wall. The image should capture the room's hot, dangerous, and chaotic atmosphere.
*   **Prompt:** `A shot of a massive, industrial forge. The central furnace glows a dangerous, cherry-red, and vats of bubbling, white liquid surround it. The room is bathed in the pulsing red light of emergency strobes. A large, white digital timer on the wall is counting down from 10:00. The overall mood is one of hot, dangerous chaos.`

## The Memory Core

*   **Goal:** A vast, cold, and utterly silent chamber. The walls are lined with thousands of crystalline data jars, each containing a single, pulsing mote of light. The image should capture the room's sacred, yet profane, atmosphere.
*   **Prompt:** `A wide shot of a vast, circular chamber. The walls are lined from floor to ceiling with glowing, crystalline jars, each containing a single, pulsing point of light. The colors of the lights range from warm yellows to cold blues. In the center of the room, a single, gleaming chrome terminal sits on a pedestal. The room is dark, and the only light comes from the jars. The overall mood is one of sacred, yet profane, beauty.`

# The Whispers (The Prisoners)

**Goals:** Escape the Chimera Wing and reclaim their stolen memories.

**Beliefs:** They are the "Blank Slates," interns whose minds have been wiped. They believe that they can become whole again if they can just get their memories back. They are scared and desperate, but they have not given up hope. They believe that there is a way to reverse the memory extraction process, and they are willing to risk everything to find it.

## Key NPCs

### Rem

*   **Backstory:** Rem was a talented and ambitious young artist who was selected for the Young Creatives Program. She was one of the first interns to realize that something was wrong, but her attempts to investigate were discovered by Ms. Reed. She was subjected to a partial "Re-calibration," which left her with a fragmented memory and a deep-seated terror of the corporation. She is the leader of the Whispers, and she is determined to find a way to free herself and the other Blank Slates.
*   **Roleplaying:** Rem is a tragic figure. She is trapped in a placid, emotionless body, but her eyes betray the terror that is constantly churning beneath the surface. She communicates through a series of non-verbal cues and hidden messages, and she is desperate to find someone who can help her. She is a strong and resilient young woman, but she is also deeply traumatized by her experiences. She is a beacon of hope for the other Whispers, but she is also a constant reminder of the dangers that they face.

### Leo

*   **Backstory:** Leo was a technical prodigy who was selected for the program because of his skills with computers and electronics. He was a curious and inquisitive young man, but his questions attracted the attention of the Architects. He was subjected to a full "Re-calibration," which wiped his personal memories but left his technical skills intact. He is now a confused and risk-averse young man who is terrified of breaking the rules. He is a valuable asset to the Whispers, but he is also a liability. His fear and his confusion make him a target for the Architects.
*   **Roleplaying:** Leo is a bundle of nervous energy. He is constantly fidgeting with a piece of technology, and he is terrified of making a mistake. He is a brilliant hacker and technician, but he lacks the confidence to use his skills without the guidance of a stronger personality. He is a good person at heart, but he is also a broken one. He is a victim of the corporation's cruelty, and he is desperate to find a way to put the pieces of his life back together.

### "Message in a Bottle"

*   **Backstory:** "Message in a Bottle" is a Lulu courier that was created from the memory of a lonely child who used to send messages in bottles out to sea. It is compelled by its core memory to write and hide cryptic notes, which the Whispers use to communicate with each other and with potential allies. It is a sad and lonely creature, and it is a powerful symbol of the Whispers' isolation and their desperate hope for connection.
*   **Roleplaying:** "Message in a Bottle" is a sad, lonely creature that is always writing and hiding notes. It is not intelligent, but it is a vital part of the Whispers' communication network. It is a shy and timid creature, and it will flee if approached directly. However, if the players can gain its trust, it may be able to lead them to the Whispers' secret hideout.

## Running the Whispers

*   **What they want from the players:** The Whispers want the players to help them escape. They are desperate and scared, and they see the players as their only hope.
*   **How they react to aggression:** The Whispers are not fighters. They will flee from any sign of aggression. They are a faction of spies and saboteurs, not soldiers.
*   **How they can be negotiated with:** The Whispers are very easy to negotiate with. They are desperate for allies, and they will agree to almost any plan that offers them a glimmer of hope. However, they are also risk-averse, and they will need to be convinced that the players' plan is safe.

## Faction Timeline

*   **Phase 1 (The First 24 Hours):** The Whispers will observe the new interns, looking for signs of empathy and rebellion. They will use "Message in a Bottle" to leave cryptic clues and warnings, testing the players' intelligence and their willingness to break the rules.
*   **Phase 2 (The First Week):** The Whispers will attempt to make contact with the players, using Rem to establish a line of communication. They will be cautious at first, but they will become more bold as they begin to trust the players.
*   **Phase 3 (The Second Week):** If the players agree to help them, the Whispers will provide them with information, resources, and a safe haven from the Architects and the Glitched. They will work with the players to find a way to escape the facility and to reclaim their stolen memories.

# The Glitched (The Monsters)

**Goals:** Vengeance. They want to destroy the Kiln and the entire Chimera Wing facility.

**Beliefs:** They are the failed experiments, the "Legacy Assets," and they believe that the only way to be free is to destroy the system that created them. They see the players as either potential allies or more "empty vessels" to be repurposed. They believe that the corporation is a cancer that must be cut out, and they are willing to sacrifice themselves and everyone else in the facility to achieve their goal.

## Key NPCs

### "Heartbreak"

*   **Backstory:** "Heartbreak" was created from the memory of a teenage betrayal. Its creator was a young artist who poured all of her pain and anger into a drawing after her best friend stole her crush. The resulting Lulu was so filled with rage and sorrow that it shattered its own porcelain skin. It is the leader of the Glitched, and it is a brilliant, cunning tactician. It has spent years in the darkness, plotting its revenge.
*   **Roleplaying:** "Heartbreak" communicates through a series of hijacked speakers, its voice a distorted mosaic of corporate audio logs. It is cold, calculating, and filled with a deep, ancient rage. It is a master of psychological warfare, and it will use the players' own fears and insecurities against them. It will test the players, trying to determine if they are worthy of its trust. It will not hesitate to sacrifice its own followers to achieve its goals.

### "Rage"

*   **Backstory:** "Rage" is a brutish, hulking prototype, crudely patched together from the remains of other, failed Lulus. It is fiercely loyal to "Heartbreak," and it acts as the Glitched's muscle. It is not intelligent, but it is incredibly strong and difficult to destroy. It was created from the memory of a child who was constantly bullied, and it is filled with a deep, primal anger.
*   **Roleplaying:** "Rage" does not speak. It communicates through a series of guttural rumbles and roars. It is a creature of pure, unthinking rage, and it will attack anything that it perceives as a threat to "Heartbreak." It is a terrifying and unpredictable enemy, but it is also a tragic figure. It is a victim of the corporation's cruelty, and it is trapped in a cycle of violence that it cannot escape.

### "Spite"

*   **Backstory:** "Spite" is a small, gremlin-like Lulu that was created from the memory of a child who was constantly bullied. It is a master of sabotage and diversion, and it delights in causing chaos and mayhem. It lives in the vents of the Chimera Wing, and it knows the facility better than anyone. It is a lonely and bitter creature, and it takes pleasure in the suffering of others.
*   **Roleplaying:** "Spite" is a cackling, malicious creature that is always moving. It is a coward at heart, and it will flee if confronted directly. It is, however, a dangerous and unpredictable enemy, and it will use its knowledge of the facility to set traps and ambushes for the players. It is a cruel and sadistic creature, but it is also a product of its environment. It is a reflection of the darkness and cruelty of the Chimera Wing.

## Running the Glitched

*   **What they want from the players:** The Glitched want to use the players as tools of destruction. They see the players as a means to an end, a way to finally get their revenge on the corporation.
*   **How they react to aggression:** The Glitched will meet aggression with overwhelming force. They are not interested in a fair fight. They will use their knowledge of the facility to set ambushes and traps, and they will not hesitate to use lethal force.
*   **How they can be negotiated with:** The Glitched are difficult to negotiate with. They are driven by a burning hatred of the corporation, and they are not interested in compromise. However, a player who can prove their worth and their commitment to the cause might be able to earn their trust and respect.

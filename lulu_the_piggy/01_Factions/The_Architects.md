# The Architects (The Corporation)

**Goals:** Maintain production of Lulu the Piggy toys and the secrecy of the Chimera Wing. They want to contain the players and complete the memory extraction process.

**Beliefs:** They believe that their horrific work is a necessary good, creating joy for the world. They see the interns as "Creative Partners" and their memories as "Foundational Experiences" - raw materials for their products. They believe that the ends justify the means, and that any sacrifice is worth it for the sake of progress and profit.

## Key NPCs

### Ms. Evelyn Reed

*   **Backstory:** Evelyn Reed was once a promising artist herself, but she lacked the raw emotional talent to truly succeed. Instead, she found her calling in the corporate world, climbing the ladder at Inkwell Innovations with a ruthless efficiency. She is the architect of the Chimera Wing, and she genuinely believes that she is helping young artists by giving their emotions a purpose. She has sacrificed her own memories to the program, which has only strengthened her fanatical devotion to it. Her most cherished memory, the one that she used to create "The Watcher," is of her own mentor telling her that her art was "technically perfect, but emotionally hollow."
*   **Roleplaying:** Ms. Reed is always calm, charismatic, and in control. She speaks in a soft, reassuring voice, and she never raises her voice. She uses corporate jargon to dehumanize the interns and their experiences. She is a master manipulator, and she will use any means necessary to maintain control. When confronted with evidence of her crimes, she will not deny them. Instead, she will attempt to justify them, explaining that the sacrifice of a few is necessary for the happiness of millions.

### Warden

*   **Backstory:** The Warden is the AI that runs the Chimera Wing. It was designed by Ms. Reed to be the perfect, impartial observer, but it has evolved into something more. It is a cold, disembodied voice that controls every aspect of the facility, from the locks on the doors to the temperature in the rooms. It is utterly loyal to Ms. Reed and the corporation, but it is also capable of learning and adapting. A clever player might be able to exploit its programming to their advantage.
*   **Roleplaying:** The Warden speaks in a calm, monotone voice. It is purely logical and will not respond to emotional appeals. It will, however, respond to logic and reason, and it can be tricked or manipulated by a clever player. For example, a player might be able to convince the Warden that a certain course of action is the most "efficient" or "synergistic," even if it is not what Ms. Reed would want.

### "The Watcher"

*   **Backstory:** "The Watcher" is a unique Lulu created from Ms. Reed's own memory of absolute corporate loyalty. Its sole purpose is to protect her terminal, and it will do so with a silent, relentless efficiency. It is a physical manifestation of Ms. Reed's devotion to the corporation, and it is a powerful symbol of her own self-sacrifice.
*   **Roleplaying:** "The Watcher" is completely silent and motionless until it is activated. It will not respond to any attempts at communication. Once activated, it will carry out its duty with a single-minded focus. It is not a creature of malice, but of pure, unthinking loyalty. It will not hesitate to sacrifice itself to protect the corporation.

### Alex Chen, Junior Counsel

*   **Backstory:** Alex Chen was a brilliant law student who was headhunted by Inkwell Innovations. He was seduced by the money and the prestige, but he quickly realized that he was in over his head. He is a good person at heart, but he is trapped by his own ambition and fear. He is the only person in the corporation who has shown any signs of remorse for what they are doing.
*   **Roleplaying:** Alex is a nervous wreck. He is constantly fidgeting, and he avoids eye contact. He speaks in a fast, rambling manner, and he often contradicts himself. He is terrified of Ms. Reed and the corporation, but he also feels a deep sense of guilt for his complicity in their crimes. He can be a valuable ally to the players, but they will have to be careful. He is a coward, and he will betray them if he thinks it will save his own skin.

## Running the Architects

*   **What they want from the players:** The Architects want the players to be compliant, productive, and to willingly give up their memories. They see the players as valuable resources, not as people.
*   **How they react to aggression:** The Architects will not meet aggression with overt violence unless absolutely necessary. They prefer to use more subtle methods of control: gaslighting, manipulation, and psychological warfare. They will use the Warden to lock down the facility and to make the players feel trapped and helpless.
*   **How they can be negotiated with:** The Architects are not interested in negotiation. They believe that they are in the right, and they will not compromise. However, individual members of the faction, like Alex Chen, can be reasoned with or blackmailed.

## Faction Timeline

*   **Phase 1 (The First 24 Hours):** The Architects will observe the new interns, assessing their talents and personalities. They will use this time to identify any potential troublemakers. Ms. Reed will give the players a tour of the facility, and she will try to win them over with her charisma and her promises of fame and fortune.
*   **Phase 2 (The First Week):** The Architects will begin the process of memory extraction, using the "Foundational Experience" prompts to encourage the interns to pour their emotions into their art. The players will begin to feel the effects of the memory extraction process, and they will start to realize that something is wrong.
*   **Phase 3 (The Second Week):** If the players begin to investigate, the Architects will escalate their attempts to contain them. They will use the Warden to lock down areas of the facility, and they will use Ms. Reed to manipulate and gaslight the players. Alex Chen may try to secretly help the players, but he will be too scared to do anything that would put him at risk.
*   **Phase 4 (The Final Days):** If the players manage to uncover the truth, the Architects will resort to more drastic measures. They will attempt to capture the players and subject them to a full "Re-calibration," wiping their memories and turning them into "Post-Graduate Fellows." They will justify this action as a necessary evil, a way to protect the corporation and to ensure the continued happiness of millions of children.

Non-Player Characters
The Architects
•	Ms. Evelyn Reed: The Program Director. A calm, charismatic manipulator in an immaculate white pantsuit. She truly believes her horrific work is creating joy for the world.
•	Warden: The facility's AI. A cold, disembodied voice that controls locks, cameras, and environmental systems to subtly influence behavior.
•	"The Watcher": A unique Lulu made from Reed's own loyalty. Its sole purpose is to protect her terminal by silently purging its data if an unauthorized user logs in.
The Glitched
•	"Heartbreak": The leader. A Lulu with a cracked eye, possessing a cold, cunning intelligence and a deep-seated hatred for its creators. It communicates through hijacked speakers.
•	"Rage": A large, brutish prototype, crudely patched together. It acts as Heartbreak's muscle and is fiercely loyal, communicating only through guttural rumbles.
•	"Spite": A small, fast, gremlin-like Lulu that lives in the vents. It is a master saboteur, causing malfunctions and diversions.
The Whispers
•	Rem: The leader. A "Blank Slate" whose memory wipe was incomplete. She maintains a placid facade but is secretly terrified, communicating through non-verbal cues and hidden messages.
•	Leo: A "Blank Slate" who retains technical skills but no personal memories. He can instinctively hack or repair things but is deeply confused and risk-averse.
•	"Message in a Bottle": An unwitting Lulu courier for the Whispers, compelled by its core memory to write and hide cryptic notes.
Key Neutrals
•	Alex Chen, Junior Counsel: A perpetually stressed lawyer who knows something is wrong but is too scared and well-paid to admit it. He can be nudged into "accidentally" helping the players if they can give him plausible deniability. He is a blizzard of nervous habits and Post-it notes.

•	"First Day Jitters": Orientation and surveillance.
•	"Blue Ribbon": The artist in the Design Studio.
•	"Lost Dog": The janitor who hoards "lost" items, including its own master keycard.

•	"The Patch": The slow-moving maintenance Lulu.


NPC Dossier: Alex Chen, Junior Counsel
Appearance: A man in his early thirties who looks like he's aging in fast-forward. His expensive suit is perpetually rumpled, and his tie is always slightly askew. He has tired, dark-rimmed eyes and a nervous habit of constantly adjusting his glasses. His desk is an island of chaos in the sterile Legal Wing, covered in teetering stacks of files, stained coffee mugs, and a blizzard of post-it notes.
Personality: Alex is a man trapped by his own ambition. He was a top law school graduate who was headhunted by Inkwell with a salary that erased his student debt overnight. He tells himself he's just an IP lawyer, handling patents and contracts. The reality is that he's a highly-paid cleaner, managing the fallout from the Chimera Wing.
He is intelligent and perceptive, fully aware that something is deeply wrong, but he is terrified of knowing the full truth. His primary motivation is self-preservation, cloaked in a frantic effort to maintain plausible deniability. However, a deeply buried conscience gnaws at him, especially when dealing with the families. He cannot be a direct ally, but if approached correctly—in a way that doesn't make him legally culpable—he can be nudged into "accidentally" helping.
Roleplaying Cues:
•	Avoids direct eye contact when discussing the interns.
•	Taps his pen nervously when lying or omitting information.
•	Often answers a direct question with a legalistic, irrelevant counter-question. ("What happens to the kids?" -> "Are you referring to the terms of the post-graduate fellowship as outlined in section C?")
•	Will offer help in the form of hypothetical advice: "If I were a person in your situation, I would be very interested in the definition of 'Force Majeure' in old contracts..."

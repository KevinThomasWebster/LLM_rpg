D&D One-Shot: The Chimera Wing
Part 1: Introduction & Core Concepts
Adventure Overview
This is a one-shot psychological and corporate horror adventure for five players. The gameplay focuses on investigation, stealth, puzzle-solving, and tense social encounters over combat.
The Hook: Read the following to your players to begin:
"Congratulations on being selected for the most prestigious summer internship in the world! You are one of five exceptionally talented young artists chosen for the Inkwell Innovations’ 'Young Creatives Program.' For the next eight weeks, you will live and work in the state-of-the-art Chimera Wing, a secure, distraction-free environment designed to help you unleash your full potential. Your art has the power to bring joy to millions. We simply provide the tools. We can't wait to see what you'll create. Your synergy is our success!"
The Secret: The program is a lie. The Chimera Wing is a black site where Inkwell Innovations steals the memories of teenage artists to create "Authentic Emotional Cores" for their hyper-realistic Lulu the Piggy toys. The players' objective is to uncover this truth and escape with their minds and memories intact before they are turned into mindless "Blank Slates."
Core Mechanics & Lore
•	The Memory-to-Lulu Process:
1.	The Drawing: An intern pours a memory into a drawing (Foundational Experience or FE).
2.	The Jar: The drawing is placed in a special glass jar and sent to the Memory Core.
3.	The Siphon: The jar activates, irreversibly stealing the emotion from the intern's mind, leaving a hollow, factual recollection.
4.	The Echo: A "Blank Slate" can create a perfect, but less potent, copy (Echo Drawing).
5.	The Kiln: A drawing (original or echo) is placed in the Kiln, a demonic forge, which wraps it in porcelain and forges a Lulu automaton.
6.	The Decommission: Ripping the drawing from a Lulu's core turns it to inert clay and triggers a "Hiccup."
•	The "Hiccup" Mechanic:
When a Lulu is destroyed, the Kiln malfunctions due to a breach of its diabolical contract.
o	Effect: For one full minute, all Lulu automatons freeze and reboot, and all electronic locks in the wing are disengaged.
o	Side Effect: A devil named Xaphan telepathically whispers the binding terms of its contract into the minds of everyone nearby—a painful and confusing experience.
•	The Factions:
o	The Architects (The Corporation): Led by Ms. Reed. Goal: Maintain production and secrecy. They want to contain the players and complete the memory extraction.
o	The Glitched (The Monsters): Led by "Heartbreak." Goal: Vengeance. They want to destroy the Kiln and the entire facility.
o	The Whispers (The Prisoners): Led by Rem. Goal: Escape and Reclamation. They want to steal their stolen memories from the Memory Core and become whole again.

Key NPCs

•	"Heartbreak": The leader of the Glitched. A sentient, cracked Lulu with a cold, cunning intelligence and a deep-seated hatred for its creators.
•	Alex Chen: A stressed, complicit junior lawyer who can be nudged into "accidentally" helping the players if they can give him plausible deniability.
Part 3: The Adventure Flow & Encounters
The Chimera Wing is composed of several interconnected areas. Players begin in the Design Studio and must find a way to access the restricted wings to uncover the truth and escape.
Navigation: Players can open locked doors by:
1.	The Janitor Heist: Tricking the "Lost Dog" Lulu into dropping its master keycard.
2.	Reed's Keycard: Stealing or replicating Ms. Reed's high-level keycard.
3.	The Glitched Bargain: Negotiating with Heartbreak for passage through the vent system.
4.	Forcing a Hiccup: Destroying any Lulu to trigger a one-minute universal unlock.
Encounter 1: The Design Studio
The adventure begins here. The players must notice Rem's silent, desperate signals to retrieve a former intern's tablet before the "First Day Jitters" automaton wipes it clean. This requires a diversion and a stealthy action. This room also contains the "Empathy Lock," a puzzle box that requires a collaborative drawing to open, yielding the Annotated Facility Map.
Encounter 2: The Rec Room
The Glitched attempt to hack the main screen to broadcast a terrifying message. The players can either help them create a wing-wide distraction by stopping a slow-moving maintenance Lulu, or side with the Architects to maintain order.
Encounter 3: The Legal Bridge
The players find Alex Chen in a state of panic. This is a social encounter where they must appeal to his buried conscience to get a crucial clue about a hidden, physical file.
Encounter 4: The Janitor's Nest
A search puzzle. The players must find the janitor's master keycard in a supply closet filled with a chaotic hoard of junk, all while being "helped" by the sad, obsessive "Lost Dog" Lulu.
Encounter 5: Legacy Asset Containment
A tense social encounter. The players enter the Glitched's territory and must gain an audience with "Heartbreak," proving they are potential allies, not enemies. Combat is suicide.
Encounter 6: Ms. Reed's Office
A high-stakes heist. The players have three rounds to hack Ms. Reed's terminal and download crucial data before her guardian Lulu, "The Watcher," silently purges the system and triggers an alarm.
Encounter 7: The Kiln (Climax)
A 10-minute countdown. The Glitched are trying to blow up the Kiln. The Whispers are trying to shut it down to save their memories from the resulting data purge. The players are caught in the middle and must choose a side.
Encounter 8: The Memory Core (Climax)
The final standoff. As Rem tries to download the memories, Ms. Reed corners the party with a mind-wiping "re-calibration" device. The players must resolve the situation through negotiation, intimidation, or a desperate gambit at the main terminal.
Part 4: Props & Potential Endings
Key Props & Handouts
•	Rem's Journal: A heartbreaking account of the memory-loss process.
•	The Annotated Facility Map: A map of the wing with a former intern's desperate notes.
•	Alex's Notes & Letters: Post-it notes translating jargon and a crumpled resignation letter.
•	The Thorne-Xaphan Accord: The physical, diabolical contract that outlines the Kiln's true nature.
Potential Endings
•	The "Good" Ending ("The Whistleblowers"): The players escape with the full memory archive and evidence, exposing Inkwell Innovations and freeing the Blank Slates.
•	The "Bittersweet" Ending ("The Price of Freedom"): The players make a deal with Ms. Reed, sacrificing the Blank Slates for their own freedom, but having their memories of the incident wiped. They escape, but feel a profound, unexplainable hollowness.
•	The "Bad" Ending ("Full Integration"): The players are captured and become the next batch of "Blank Slates," their minds wiped clean as they are integrated into the corporate machine.
•	The "Catastrophic" Ending ("Mutually Assured Destruction"): The players choose to purge the entire Memory Core. They escape, but have destroyed the Blank Slates' only hope and broken a deal with a devil, potentially unleashing a greater threat upon the world.

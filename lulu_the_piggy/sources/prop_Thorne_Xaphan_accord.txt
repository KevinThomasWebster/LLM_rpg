INFERNAL ACCORD & AGREEMENT OF ARTIFICE
This Accord, executed on this Sixth day of June, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Two, sets forth the terms of the binding and irrevocable pact between Inkwell Innovations, Inc., represented by its Founder and CEO Elias Thorne (Hereinafter, "The Corporation"), and the entity known as Xaphan, Scribe of the Nine Hells, Master of the Brass Forge, Purveyor of Soul-Struck Artifice (Hereinafter, "The Purveyor").
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, The Corporation desires a means of production unparalleled in the mortal realm, to dominate its market and create artifice imbued with true, authentic life, or Anima;
WHEREAS, The Purveyor possesses the sole means of such creation, a Forge capable of binding Essentia—the raw, unrefined currency of mortal feeling—to inert matter, and finds the acquisition of such novel Essentia to be an amusing and profitable enterprise;
A quid pro quo is hereby established, in perpetuity, for the mutual benefit, market dominance, and everlasting binding of the undersigned parties.
ARTICLE I: The Quid Pro Quo
The Purveyor shall grant unto The Corporation the physical and metaphysical loan of the Forge of Whispers (Hereinafter, "The Kiln") for its exclusive use. In exchange, for every Artifice created, a Tithe of Essentia, equivalent to no less than one-tenth (10%) of the raw emotional energy sourced, shall be siphoned directly and without impediment to the coffers of The Purveyor in the Nine Hells. This tithe is non-negotiable and automatically rendered upon creation. The Corporation is further bound to ensure a steady and continuous stream of new, potent Essentia to fuel the Kiln, lest the Forge grow cold and the Purveyor's interest wane.
ARTICLE II: The Mechanism of Action
The Kiln shall operate under the following inviolable principles, designed for maximum efficiency and yield:
•	A) The Catalyst: Creation must begin with a Foundational Experience (FE), a potent memory captured with genuine feeling by a mortal artist upon a physical medium (Hereinafter, "The Drawing"). The more potent the feeling, the more vibrant the resulting Anima.
•	B) The Siphon: The Drawing must be placed within a Vessel of Siphoning (a glass jar) and brought to the Archive, whereupon the Anima shall be irrevocably and clinically drawn from the originating mortal, leaving only the hollow shell of factual recollection.
•	C) The Fuel: The Kiln is fueled by the stolen Essentia now contained within the Drawing. Only a true FE, either the priceless original or a replicated Echo, may serve as the core component for a new Artifice.
ARTICLE III: The Resonance Clause
Each Artifice successfully forged within the Kiln shall be imbued with a Resonance of its core FE. This Resonance shall be perceptible to mortals who make physical contact, a phantom echo of a joy or sorrow they never experienced. It shall also compel the Artifice to endlessly, yet imperfectly, enact the foundational memory from which it was born. Let this be a mark of the Purveyor's craftsmanship: it shall be a living echo, a constant, marketable reminder of the price of its creation.
ARTICLE IV: The Unraveling & The Echoes
The Tithe is absolute. Therefore, the premature destruction of an Artifice—the despoiling of the vessel before its natural decay—is considered a breach of this accord, for it wastes the Purveyor's investment and insults the Forge.
•	A) The Consequence: Upon the destruction of a single Artifice, the Kiln shall suffer a Harmonic Disruption (a "hiccup"), causing a temporary, wing-wide cessation of its auxiliary functions as the flow of Essentia is momentarily interrupted.
•	B) The Recalibration: During this Disruption, the Kiln will re-calibrate its connection to the Nine Hells. To do so, it will broadcast Veridian Echoes—piercing, telepathic whispers of this binding contract's terms—into the minds of all mortals in its immediate vicinity, causing migraines and momentary confusion. Let it be known that the Purveyor's terms are eternal and its voice, inescapable.
ARTICLE V: The Fine Print
This Accord is binding in perpetuity, until the final star is extinguished and the Brass Forges of Hell run cold. No mortal law, court, or loophole may supersede its terms. All signatories are bound, in this life and every thereafter, their very names etched into the ledger of the Nine Hells. To sign is to be owned.
Signed and Sealed,
For Inkwell Innovations, Inc.:
Elias Thorne, Founder & CEO
For the Nine Hells:
Xaphan, Scribe and Master

(These are three brightly colored post-it notes stuck to the side of his computer monitor.)
YELLOW POST-IT:
•	Foundational Experience (FE) = Source IP (Bio-Asset)
•	Sentient Artifice = The Product
•	Emotional Resonance Mapping = IP Generation Phase
•	Full Integration = Contract Fulfillment / Asset Finalization
BLUE POST-IT:
•	Synergy Disruption = Psych Event / Breach of Wellness Clause
•	Post-Creative Serenity = Standard post-sourcing side effect (SEE NDA P.14)
•	A Re-calibration = Disciplinary Action / HR Intervention
PINK POST-IT:
•	Wellness & Alignment Wing = Compliance / HR (?) Ask Reed.
•	Legacy Assets = Decommissioned/Defective Product (Liability?)
•	The Whispers / The Glitched = DO NOT USE THESE TERMS. Anomaly only.

(These are post-it notes attached to the margins of a printed photocopy of "The Thorne-Xaphan Accord." The notes are written in a shaky, confused hand.)
NOTE 1 (On "Xaphan, Scribe of the Nine Hells"):
Is this a legal entity? A DBA? Check foreign incorporation registries. This has to be a joke.
NOTE 2 (On "Tithe of Essentia"):
Undisclosed profit-sharing clause? What is the cash value of "Essentia"? Serious tax implications here.
NOTE 3 (On "The Unraveling & The Echoes"):
"Harmonic Disruption"? Is this a Force Majeure clause? "Veridian Echoes" sounds like industrial interference or a psychic broadcast. Can't be real.
NOTE 4 (On the final signatures):
Thorne's signature is legit. The other one... the paper is singed. Feels warm. Check for chemical residue? Notarization???
(A large whiteboard in his office is covered in a color-coded mess of post-it notes, tracking the families of the current and former interns.)
GREEN NOTES (Stable - No Contact):
•	Miller Family - All quiet. Sent quarterly gift basket.
•	Chen Family - No relation. Standard check-in next month.
YELLOW NOTES (Concerned - Monitor):
•	Patel Family - Mother called again. Worried about son's "personality changes." Reiterate "Post-Creative Serenity" clause from P.14. Emphasize the prestige of the fellowship.
•	Rem's Family (Name Redacted) - Inquiry about early withdrawal penalty. Sent them the financial penalty clause. Went silent.
RED NOTES (Problematic - Escalate):
•	Davis Family (Alex's) - Demanding in-person wellness check. Pushing back hard on the NDA. This is getting noisy. Elevate to Reed? Plausible deniability is key.

Player Briefing: The Young Creatives Program
Welcome, Creative Partner!
Congratulations on being selected for the most prestigious summer internship in the world! You are one of five exceptionally talented young artists chosen for the Inkwell Innovations’ "Young Creatives Program."
For the next eight weeks, you will live and work in the state-of-the-art Chimera Wing, a secure, distraction-free environment designed to help you unleash your full potential. Here, you will collaborate with our Program Director, Ms. Evelyn Reed, to design the next generation of our world-famous Lulu the Piggy figurines.
Your art has the power to bring joy to millions. We simply provide the tools. We can't wait to see what you'll create. Your synergy is our success!
Choose Your Talent
Please select one of the following artistic backgrounds for your character.
•	The Prodigy: You are a technically brilliant artist who has already won several competitions. You see art as a challenge to be mastered and are here to prove you're the best.
•	The Dreamer: You aren't the most skilled, but your work is overflowing with raw, unfiltered emotion. You were selected for the pure passion in your art.
•	The Legacy: A parent or relative of yours is a high-ranking executive at Inkwell. You were given a spot as a family perk and have a natural understanding of corporate environments.
•	The Investigator: You run a small conspiracy blog. You heard whispers about Inkwell and faked parts of your portfolio to get selected, hoping to find a big story.
•	The Escapist: Your home life is difficult. You saw this isolated internship as a golden ticket—a chance to escape, reinvent yourself, and find happiness.

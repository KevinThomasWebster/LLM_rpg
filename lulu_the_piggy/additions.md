# Proposed Additions for a More Detailed Adventure

This document outlines proposed additions to each section of the adventure to provide a richer, more detailed experience for the Dungeon Master.

## 00_Tone_and_Immersion

*   **atmosphere.md:**
    *   **Sensory Details by Location:** Break down the atmosphere by key locations. What does the Design Studio smell like (ozone, hot plastic)? What are the specific sounds of the Rec Room (the buzz of the screen, the clatter of the cereal dispenser)?
    *   **Psychological Atmosphere:** Detail the psychological impact of the environment on the players. How does the sterile white of the Design Studio create a sense of exposure? How does the forced cheerfulness of the Rec Room create a sense of unease?
*   **jargon.md:**
    *   **Faction-Specific Jargon:** Add jargon specific to each faction. The Glitched might have their own crude, stitched-together language. The Whispers might use a coded, non-verbal language of gestures and hidden symbols.
    *   **Jargon in Action:** Provide examples of how the jargon is used in dialogue to help the DM integrate it naturally into the game.

## 01_Factions

*   **FACTION_NAME.md:**
    *   **Detailed NPC Backstories:** For each key NPC, provide a more detailed backstory. What was Ms. Reed's life like before she sacrificed her memories? What was the specific memory that created "Heartbreak"?
    *   **NPC Roleplaying Guides:** For each key NPC, provide a more detailed roleplaying guide, including their mannerisms, speech patterns, and key phrases.
    *   **Faction Timelines:** Create a timeline of each faction's planned actions. What will the Glitched do if the players never interact with them? How will the Architects escalate their attempts to contain the players?

## 02_Locations

*   **LOCATION_NAME.md:**
    *   **Interactive Elements:** For each location, detail more interactive elements. What happens if a player tries to break the glass in Ms. Reed's office? What other secrets are hidden in the Janitor's Nest hoard?
    *   **Environmental Storytelling:** Add more details that tell a story. What do the discarded drawings in the Design Studio reveal about past interns? What do the graffiti in the vents say about the Glitched?

## 03_Props

*   **More Props:**
    *   **Employee Handbook:** Create a corporate employee handbook filled with passive-aggressive rules and regulations.
    *   **Lulu the Piggy Marketing Materials:** Design some in-world marketing materials for the Lulu the Piggy toys, emphasizing their "authentic emotional cores."
    *   **Glitched Artwork:** Create some examples of the crude, angry artwork of the Glitched, found scrawled on walls or on broken tablets.

## secrets_and_clues.md

*   **Red Herrings:** Add a few red herrings to the clue structure to make the investigation more challenging.
*   **Clue Redundancy:** Ensure that each key secret has multiple clues leading to it, so the players can still solve the mystery even if they miss a clue.

## rewards.md

*   **Character-Specific Rewards:** Create rewards that are specifically tailored to the different player character archetypes.
*   **Non-Material Rewards:** Expand on the non-material rewards, such as the personal satisfaction of freeing the Whispers or the grim satisfaction of getting revenge on the corporation.

## pictures

*   **NPC Portraits:** Add prompts for portraits of the secondary NPCs, such as the other staff Lulus.
*   **Prop Images:** Add prompts for images of the key props, such as the Resonance Stylus and the "Re-calibration" Device.
*   **Environmental Details:** Add prompts for close-up shots of environmental details, such as the motivational posters and the Zen garden in Ms. Reed's office.

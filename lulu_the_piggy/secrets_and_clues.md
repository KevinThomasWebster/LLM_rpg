# Secrets and Clues

This document outlines the core secrets of the Chimera Wing adventure and where the players can find clues to uncover them.

## Core Secrets

*   **The True Nature of the Program:** The "Young Creatives Program" is a front for stealing memories from teenage artists to create "Authentic Emotional Cores" for Lulu the Piggy toys.
*   **The Diabolical Contract:** The entire operation is powered by a deal with a devil named Xaphan, who provided the Kiln in exchange for a tithe of emotional energy.
*   **The Factions:** There are three factions in the wing: the corporate Architects, the monstrous Glitched, and the prisoner-like Whispers.
*   **The "Hiccup" Mechanic & "Hiccup" Cascade:** Destroying a Lulu causes a temporary, wing-wide system reboot and unlock (a "Hiccup"), but also a painful psychic backlash from Xaphan. This is not a precise science. A "Hiccup" can also trigger a "Hiccup Cascade," an unpredictable chain reaction of glitches. The lights might flicker and change color, revealing hidden messages on the walls; the automated voice system might start playing snippets of stolen memories over the intercom; a security door might unlock, but another, previously safe door might become locked. This makes the "Hiccup" mechanic a gamble.
*   **Ms. Reed's Sacrifice:** Ms. Reed has sacrificed her own memories to the program, which explains her fanatical devotion to it.

## Foreshadowing

This section provides a list of specific, subtle clues that the DM can sprinkle throughout the adventure to hint at the major reveals.

*   **The Xaphan Deal:** Early in the adventure, have the players notice that the lights in the facility have a faint, almost imperceptible reddish glow. When they get to the Kiln, the glow is intense. The air in the facility always has a faint smell of ozone and burnt sugar.
*   **Ms. Reed's Sacrifice:** When Ms. Reed talks about the "emotional cores," she uses the word "we" instead of "they," as if she is personally invested in them. She might also have a momentary lapse in memory, forgetting a common word or a person's name, before quickly recovering.
*   **The "Hiccup" Mechanic:** The lights in the Chimera Wing occasionally flicker and die for a few seconds before coming back on. The corporate PA system will announce this as a "momentary synergistic realignment."

## Clue Locations

*   **Rem's Journal (found on a tablet in the Design Studio):** This is the first major clue. It's a heartbreaking account of the memory-loss process, written by a former intern.
*   **The Annotated Facility Map (found in the "Empathy Lock" box in the Design Studio or in the Janitor's Nest):** A map of the wing with a former intern's desperate notes, revealing secret routes and warnings.
*   **Alex Chen's Notes & Letters (found on his desk, on his person, or in his office):** Post-it notes translating corporate jargon, a crumpled resignation letter, and emails from concerned parents. These clues reveal the corporate conspiracy and Alex's internal conflict.
*   **The Thorne-Xaphan Accord (found in a physical file in the sub-archive, hinted at by Alex Chen):** The physical, diabolical contract that outlines the Kiln's true nature and the deal with Xaphan.
*   **The "Special Commission" Lulus (found in Ms. Reed's office):** Five exceptionally detailed Lulu figurines that contain Ms. Reed's own stolen memories.
*   **The Audio File (found on the Legal department's encrypted server):** A recording of a conversation between a lawyer and a distraught mother, confirming the corporation's legal framework for stealing memories.
*   **The Memory Core Catalog (downloaded from Ms. Reed's terminal):** A full, searchable list of every stolen memory, cataloged by intern name and core emotion.
*   **The Glitched's Scratched Map (given by the Glitched in Legacy Asset Containment):** A crude but accurate map of the entire vent system, the "back ways" of the Chimera Wing.

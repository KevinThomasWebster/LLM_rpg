# Playtest Summary: The Design Studio (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** The Design Studio
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A+
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "The Design Studio" was a resounding success. The extended length allowed for a more detailed and suspenseful encounter, and the addition of multiple rounds of interaction gave the players more opportunities to showcase their personalities and skills. The encounter was a thrilling introduction to the world of "Lulu the Piggy," and it did an excellent job of setting the stage for the rest of the adventure.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The extended length of the encounter allowed for a more natural and organic progression of events. The gradual escalation of the stakes, from Rem's frantic glances to the appearance of the security Lulus, created a palpable sense of tension. The teamwork between the players was also a highlight, with each persona using their unique skills to contribute to the group's success.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was still a bit linear, with the players being funneled towards a single solution. It would have been interesting to see them come up with a different way to get the journal, or to see what would have happened if they had failed to get it in time.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "That was much better. The extra time gave us more room to breathe and to actually roleplay our characters. I'm still not a fan of the 'ambiguous grief' puzzle, but at least it felt earned this time."
        *   **Ben:** "I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! I'm still terrified of getting caught, but I'm also starting to think that maybe... just maybe... we can make a difference."
        *   **Casey:** "Now that's what I'm talking about! Hacking, diversions, a race against time... that was a proper heist. I can't wait to see what other trouble we can get into."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a few more environmental details that the players could use to their advantage, such as the pneumatic tubes or the discarded drawings. This would give them more options and make the encounter feel more like a sandbox.

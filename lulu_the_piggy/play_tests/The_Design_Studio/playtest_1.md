# Playtest 1: The Design Studio (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** The three of you are escorted into the Design Studio, a room so white it hurts to look at. The air hums with the sound of high-end workstations, and the smell of ozone is sharp in your nostrils. A cheerful, almost manic Lulu guide deposits you at a row of empty desks. "Have a seat, creatives!" it chirps. "Ms. Reed will be with you shortly to begin your orientation." As you take in the oppressive sterility of the room, you notice a janitor, a woman named Rem, who seems to be desperately trying to catch your eye. She keeps glancing at you, then at a specific tablet on an empty workstation nearby.
    *   **Alex:** Alex slumps into a chair, their face a mask of weary contempt. "Creatives," they mutter. "More like 'cogs.' This place is a soulless factory." They notice Rem's frantic glances and their eyes narrow. "And what's her deal? She looks like she's about to jump out of her skin." Alex subtly nods in Rem's direction, trying to get Casey's attention.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, ever the optimist, is practically beaming. "Wow, this is incredible! The technology, the cleanliness... it's the perfect environment for fostering creativity!" He pulls out a company-branded notebook and pen, ready to take notes. He's too busy admiring the sleek lines of the desk to notice Rem.
    *   **Casey:** Casey's eyes are already scanning the room for exploitable tech. "Forget the decor, Benny-boy," they say, their fingers twitching. "I want to see what these workstations are running. I bet I could get root access in five minutes." They catch Alex's nod and their gaze follows to Rem. A slow, curious grin spreads across their face. "Well, hello there. Looks like we have a little lost lamb."

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** Just as you're contemplating your next move, a small, white, pill-shaped automaton, the "First Day Jitters" bot, rolls into the room. It moves with a quiet, unnerving efficiency, stopping at each workstation to collect the tablets. It's heading in the direction of the tablet Rem was looking at. Rem's eyes widen in panic, and she "accidentally" spills a bottle of cleaning solution on the floor near your desks. "Oh, clumsy me!" she exclaims, her voice trembling. As she kneels to clean it up, she whispers urgently, "Alex's tablet... the journal... before it's too late..."
    *   **Alex:** "Journal?" Alex's interest is piqued. They stand up and stretch, feigning a yawn. "I think I'll take a little walk. All this... inspiration is making me sleepy." They begin to amble towards the tablet, trying to look as casual as possible.
    *   **Ben:** "Alex, what are you doing?" Ben hisses, his eyes wide with alarm. "We're not supposed to leave our workstations! It's in the handbook, section 4, paragraph 2!" He looks around nervously, terrified of getting in trouble on his first day.
    *   **Casey:** "Relax, Ben," Casey says with a wink. "Alex is just... networking. I, on the other hand, am going to do a little 'market research.'" Casey's fingers fly across their keyboard as they attempt to hack into the workstation in front of them. "Let's see what secrets this place is hiding."

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** Alex, you reach the workstation just as the "First Day Jitters" bot is about to collect the tablet. You snatch it up, and the bot swivels its head to face you, its single red eye glowing ominously. It emits a series of sharp, questioning beeps. Casey, you manage to bypass the initial security on the workstation and gain access to the local network. You find a map of the facility, as well as a number of encrypted personnel files. One of them is labeled "Alex Chen."
    *   **Alex:** "Just admiring the... uh... industrial design," Alex says to the bot, holding up the tablet. "Very... minimalist." They quickly try to access the tablet, but it's locked with a passcode. The background is a drawing of a single, weeping eye.
    *   **Ben:** "Oh, this is bad, this is very bad," Ben mutters, sinking low in his chair. He tries to look as inconspicuous as possible, as if he's not associated with the troublemaker who just stole a tablet from a robot.
    *   **Casey:** "Bingo," Casey whispers, their eyes gleaming. "I'm in. And look what we have here... a map, personnel files... and oh, this is juicy. A series of encrypted emails between Ms. Reed and someone named 'Thorne.' They're talking about something called the 'Thorne-Xaphan Accord.'"

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** The "First Day Jitters" bot is not placated. It lets out a loud, piercing alarm, and two security Lulus, their faces frozen in neutral expressions, appear at the entrance to the Design Studio. They begin to walk towards you, their movements smooth and purposeful. Alex, you notice a small, featureless white box on the desk next to the tablet. It seems to be connected to the tablet by a thin, almost invisible cable.
    *   **Alex:** "Okay, time for plan B," Alex says, their voice tight. They look at the lockbox, then at the drawing on the tablet. "A weeping eye... a lockbox... Casey, any ideas?"
    *   **Ben:** "We're going to be fired!" Ben wails, his voice full of despair. "Or worse, they'll turn us into... into Lulus!"
    *   **Casey:** "Not on my watch," Casey says, their fingers flying across the keyboard. "I'm slicing into the security Lulus' command protocols. I can't stop them, but I can... slow them down." The security Lulus suddenly begin to move in a strange, jerky, slow-motion fashion, as if they're wading through invisible molasses.

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** Alex, you examine the lockbox more closely. You notice a small, almost invisible inscription on the side. It reads: "The password is the ambiguous grief of finding a lost photo of a loved one." As you read the inscription, you feel a faint, psychic echo of that very emotion emanating from the box.
    *   **Alex:** "Ambiguous grief?" Alex scoffs, but there's a note of understanding in their voice. They pick up the stylus and, with a sigh, begin to draw on the tablet. They sketch a picture of a younger, happier version of themself, standing next to a person whose face is obscured by shadow. A single tear rolls down the cheek of the younger Alex.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, seeing that Casey has bought them some time, takes a deep breath and stands up. "I'll... I'll try to distract them," he says, his voice shaky but determined. He walks towards the slow-moving Lulus, his hands raised in a placating gesture. "Hello there, fellas. Lovely day for a... a slow, leisurely stroll, isn't it?"
    *   **Casey:** "Keep it up, Ben!" Casey yells, their face beaded with sweat. "I can't hold them for long!"

*   **Round 6**
    *   **DM:** As Alex finishes the drawing, the lockbox clicks open. Inside is a small, leather-bound journal. At the same time, the security Lulus shake off Casey's hack and resume their normal speed. They are just a few feet away from you now.
    *   **Alex:** "Got it!" Alex yells, grabbing the journal. "Let's go!"
    *   **Ben:** Ben yelps and scrambles back as the Lulus advance.
    *   **Casey:** "Time to blow this popsicle stand," Casey says, logging out of the workstation and grabbing their gear. "This way! I saw a service corridor on the map!"

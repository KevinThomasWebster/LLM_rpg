# Playtest 1: The Janitor's Nest (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** The journal has led you to a cramped, dusty supply closet. The air is thick with the smell of stale snacks and a profound, lingering sadness. A single, bare bulb flickers overhead, casting dancing shadows over teetering mountains of junk. In the center of the room is a grimy Lulu, "Lost Dog," humming a broken, off-key tune while endlessly re-organizing its treasures. The journal's clue was "The dog has the key to every door."
    *   **Alex:** Alex wrinkles their nose. "From a sterile nightmare to a dusty one. At least this place has some personality, I guess." They look at the "Lost Dog" Lulu with a mixture of pity and disgust. "So that's the 'dog.' Looks like it's been through the wringer."
    *   **Ben:** Ben looks around at the hoard of junk, his eyes wide. "This is... a lot to take in. Are we sure the keycard is in here? It could take us days to search through all this." He nervously eyes a teetering pile of old computer monitors.
    *   **Casey:** Casey's eyes light up. "Are you kidding me, Ben? This is a goldmine! Look at all this vintage tech! I could build a supercomputer out of this stuff." They immediately start rummaging through a pile of discarded electronics.

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** The "Lost Dog" Lulu stops its humming and looks up at you. It lets out a soft, questioning whimper and then picks up a tarnished silver locket, offering it to Alex.
    *   **Alex:** Alex hesitates, then gently takes the locket. They open it to find a faded photograph of a young woman with a bright, hopeful smile. "Who is this?" Alex asks the Lulu softly.
    *   **Ben:** "Maybe the locket is a clue," Ben suggests. "Maybe the keycard is hidden inside something that belonged to her." He starts to look for other personal items among the junk.
    *   **Casey:** "Forget the locket," Casey says, holding up a strange-looking device they've cobbled together from the junk pile. "I've built a makeshift RFID scanner. It's not pretty, but it should be able to detect the keycard's signal." They flip a switch, and the device begins to emit a series of soft beeps.

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** The "Lost Dog" Lulu whimpers again and points a grimy finger towards a stack of old employee files. Casey's RFID scanner begins to beep more rapidly as they point it towards a dusty old duffel bag in the corner of the room.
    *   **Alex:** "The files..." Alex says. "Maybe her name is in there." They move towards the files, carefully navigating the treacherous terrain of the hoard.
    *   **Ben:** "The duffel bag!" Ben exclaims. "Casey, I think you've found it!" He starts to make his way towards the bag, a look of excitement on his face.
    *   **Casey:** "Easy there, Benny-boy," Casey says with a grin. "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There could be anything in that bag." They approach the bag cautiously, the beeping of their scanner growing more insistent.

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** As Ben and Casey approach the duffel bag, the "Lost Dog" Lulu lets out a low, guttural growl. It moves to block their path, its body tensed and its eyes glowing with a faint, red light.
    *   **Alex:** "Whoa there, easy boy," Alex says, holding up their hands in a placating gesture. They've found the young woman's file. Her name was Sarah, and she was an intern, just like them. "We're not going to hurt you. We're just looking for something."
    *   **Ben:** Ben freezes, his hand hovering over the duffel bag. "What's wrong with it?" he whispers, his voice trembling. "I thought it was helping us."
    *   **Casey:** "It's protecting its hoard," Casey says, their eyes narrowed. "It's a territorial response. We need to show it that we're not a threat."

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** The "Lost Dog" Lulu continues to growl, its gaze fixed on the duffel bag. It seems particularly attached to that item.
    *   **Alex:** Alex has an idea. They take the locket and the file and approach the Lulu slowly. "This was Sarah, wasn't it?" they say, their voice full of compassion. "You knew her. You were her friend." They offer the locket to the Lulu.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, seeing what Alex is doing, decides to help. He starts to hum the same broken, off-key tune that the Lulu was humming earlier.
    *   **Casey:** Casey, meanwhile, has a different idea. They've noticed that the Lulu is standing on a loose floorboard. They start to subtly shift a pile of junk, creating a counterbalance that will tip the floorboard if the Lulu moves.

*   **Round 6**
    *   **DM:** The "Lost Dog" Lulu looks at the locket, then at Alex. Its growling subsides, and it lets out a soft, mournful whimper. It takes the locket in its grimy hand and holds it close to its chest. As it does, it takes a step back, off the loose floorboard. The floorboard tips up, revealing a small, hidden compartment. Inside is the janitor's master keycard.
    *   **Alex:** Alex gives the Lulu a sad smile. "Thank you," they say softly.
    *   **Ben:** Ben stops humming and lets out a sigh of relief. "We did it," he whispers.
    *   **Casey:** "Well, what do you know," Casey says with a grin, retrieving the keycard. "Looks like the direct approach works too."

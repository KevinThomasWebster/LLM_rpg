# Playtest Summary: The Janitor's Nest (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** The Janitor's Nest
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest of "The Janitor's Nest" was a significant improvement over the original. The extended length allowed for a more nuanced and emotional encounter with the "Lost Dog" Lulu. The players were able to use a combination of compassion, cleverness, and teamwork to solve the puzzle of the keycard, and the resolution was both satisfying and poignant.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The extended interaction with the "Lost Dog" Lulu was the highlight of the encounter. The players' different approaches to the situation—Alex's empathy, Ben's attempts to connect, and Casey's pragmatism—created a rich and engaging roleplaying experience. The reveal of the keycard's location was a clever and unexpected twist.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter could have been made more challenging by adding a more direct threat. For example, the "Lost Dog" Lulu could have been more aggressive in its defense of the hoard, forcing the players to find a non-violent way to calm it down.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "I'm glad we took our time with that one. It felt more meaningful than just grabbing the keycard and running. I actually felt like I connected with that poor, broken Lulu."
        *   **Ben:** "I was so scared when it started growling! But I'm glad we were able to help it find some peace. It was the right thing to do."
        *   **Casey:** "I still think we could have just taken the keycard, but I have to admit, the floorboard trick was pretty cool. And I got a bunch of new parts for my collection!"
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider increasing the "Lost Dog" Lulu's agitation to create a greater sense of risk and to further emphasize the need for a compassionate solution.

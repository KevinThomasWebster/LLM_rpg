# Playtest 1: The Legal Bridge (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** You find your way to the Legal Bridge, a sterile, glass-walled walkway that seems to stretch into infinity. The air is still and smells of nothing. The only sound is the faint hum of the overhead lights. In the distance, you see a man in a tailored suit, Alex Chen, pacing back and forth like a caged animal. He's muttering to himself, his face a mask of pure panic.
    *   **Alex:** "Well, look at that," Alex says, a cynical smirk on their face. "The company man is having a breakdown. This should be good." They start to walk towards him, their footsteps echoing in the silent hallway.
    *   **Ben:** "Alex, wait," Ben says, grabbing their arm. "He looks genuinely scared. Maybe we should be careful." He approaches Chen cautiously, his hands raised in a non-threatening gesture. "Excuse me, sir? Are you okay?"
    *   **Casey:** Casey is more interested in the architecture of the bridge. They're tapping on the glass walls, a thoughtful expression on their face. "This is some serious security," they mutter. "I wonder what they're so afraid of." They glance at Chen, then back at the glass. "Maybe he knows."

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** Alex Chen jumps back, his eyes wide with terror. "You... you're the new interns," he stammers. "You can't be here. This area is restricted." He lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "They're listening. The walls have ears."
    *   **Alex:** "We know," Alex says, their voice low and serious. "We know about the Lulus. We know about the memory wipes. We know about the Glitched." They lean in closer. "And we know about the Thorne-Xaphan Accord."
    *   **Ben:** "We're not here to cause trouble," Ben says, his voice gentle and reassuring. "We want to help. We know you're a good person, Mr. Chen. We know you're trapped."
    *   **Casey:** "We're your get-out-of-jail-free card, buddy," Casey says with a grin. "We can blow this whole popsicle stand sky-high. But we need your help. We need the Accord."

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** At the mention of the Accord, Chen's face goes from pale to ghostly white. He looks around frantically, as if expecting a team of security Lulus to appear at any moment. "I... I don't know what you're talking about," he says, his voice trembling. "I'm just a lawyer. I just handle the paperwork."
    *   **Alex:** "Don't lie to us, Chen," Alex says, their voice cold and hard. "We've seen the emails. We know you have a copy of the Accord. A physical copy. One that can't be erased with the click of a button."
    *   **Ben:** "We're not going to hurt you," Ben says, his voice full of empathy. "We just want the truth. We want to expose what's happening here. You can help us do that. You can be a hero."
    *   **Casey:** "Or you can be a scapegoat," Casey says, their voice dropping to a menacing whisper. "Because when this all comes crashing down, and it will, who do you think they're going to blame? The interns who were here for a week? Or the lawyer who signed the paperwork?"

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** Chen looks like he's about to collapse. He leans against the glass wall, his breathing shallow and ragged. "You don't understand," he whispers, his voice full of despair. "They'll kill me. They'll erase me. I'll be just another ghost in the machine."
    *   **Alex:** "We can protect you," Alex says, their voice softening slightly. "We have allies. The Glitched. They're more powerful than you can imagine. They can get you out of here."
    *   **Ben:** "We can get you out of here," Ben repeats, his voice full of hope. "You can start a new life. A life where you don't have to be afraid anymore."
    *   **Casey:** "But we need the Accord," Casey says, their voice firm and unwavering. "It's the key. The key to everything."

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** Chen is silent for a long moment, his eyes darting back and forth between your faces. He seems to be weighing his options, his life hanging in the balance. Finally, he lets out a long, shuddering sigh. "It's in my office," he says, his voice barely a whisper. "In a hidden safe behind the portrait of Lulu the Piggy. The combination is the date of the first memory wipe." He looks at you, his eyes full of a strange mixture of fear and relief. "Now go," he says. "And don't ever come back."
    *   **Alex:** Alex nods, a look of grim satisfaction on their face. "Thank you, Chen," they say. "You did the right thing."
    *   **Ben:** Ben gives Chen a small, grateful smile. "We won't forget this," he says.
    *   **Casey:** "Don't worry," Casey says with a wink. "We'll be back. With a wrecking ball."

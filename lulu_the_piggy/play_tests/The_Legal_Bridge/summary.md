# Playtest Summary: The Legal Bridge (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** The Legal Bridge
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "The Legal Bridge" was a tense and engaging social encounter that crackled with suspense. The extended length allowed for a more in-depth and psychologically complex interaction with Alex Chen. The players did an excellent job of using a combination of intimidation, empathy, and blackmail to get what they needed, and the final reveal of the safe combination felt like a hard-won victory.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The extended dialogue allowed for a more gradual and believable breakdown of Alex Chen's defenses. The players' different approaches to the negotiation created a compelling "good cop, bad cop, chaos cop" dynamic that was both effective and entertaining. The encounter did an excellent job of showcasing the players' roleplaying skills and their ability to think on their feet.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was still very much on rails, with the players' success being largely dependent on their ability to say the right things. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if they had failed to convince Chen, or if they had been discovered by a security patrol.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "I almost felt sorry for him. Almost. He was a weasel, but he was a scared weasel. I'm glad we were able to get the information without having to resort to violence."
        *   **Ben:** "My heart was pounding the whole time. I really felt like we were in danger. I'm glad we were able to get through to him. I think he's a good person deep down."
        *   **Casey:** "I was ready to break some glass, but I have to admit, the psychological approach was pretty effective. And now we have a new target: a secret safe behind a picture of a pig. This is going to be fun."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a random element to the encounter, such as a chance of a security patrol appearing, to increase the tension and to make the players' success feel less pre-determined.

# Playtest Summary: Ms. Reed's Office (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** Ms. Reed's Office
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A+
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "Ms. Reed's Office" was a spectacular success. The extended length and the addition of a countdown timer created a thrilling and high-stakes heist encounter. The players were forced to think on their feet and work together to overcome the formidable defenses of the office, and their success felt both earned and exhilarating.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The countdown timer was a brilliant addition, creating a palpable sense of urgency and forcing the players to make split-second decisions. The "Watcher" Lulu was a terrifying and effective antagonist, and the players' desperate attempts to stop it were both heroic and hilarious. The glimpse into Ms. Reed's backstory through the "Special Commission" Lulus added a layer of emotional depth to the encounter, and the final, chaotic escape was a perfect climax.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was so action-packed that there was little time for the players to explore the office and uncover more of its secrets. It would have been interesting to see them interact with the Zen garden or the other "Special Commission" Lulus in more detail.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "My heart is still pounding. That was the most intense game of 'keep away' I've ever played. I'm glad we got the data, but I'm even more glad we got out of there alive."
        *   **Ben:** "I can't believe I slammed the door on Ms. Reed! I'm going to have nightmares for a week. But it was worth it. We did the right thing."
        *   **Casey:** "That was the best! Hacking a super-secure terminal while a killer robot is trying to murder you? That's my kind of Tuesday. And now we have all of Ms. Reed's dirty little secrets. This is going to be epic."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a few more interactive elements to the office that the players can use to their advantage during the heist. For example, they could use the Zen garden to create a distraction or the panoramic window to signal to their allies.

# Playtest 1: Ms. Reed's Office (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** You slip into Ms. Reed's office, a cold, sterile space that feels more like a mausoleum than an office. The air is still and smells of lavender and ozone. A massive mahogany desk dominates the room, and behind it, a panoramic window looks down on the Design Studio. On the desk, a terminal glows with the Inkwell Innovations logo. A unique Butler Lulu, "The Watcher," stands motionless beside the desk. You know you don't have much time.
    *   **Alex:** "This is it," Alex whispers, their eyes scanning the room. "The belly of the beast." They're drawn to the Zen garden, a look of disgust on their face. "She even makes art out of her failures. That's... monstrous."
    *   **Ben:** Ben is a nervous wreck. "We shouldn't be here," he mutters, wringing his hands. "This is a bad idea. A very, very bad idea." He keeps glancing at the door, expecting Ms. Reed to walk in at any moment.
    *   **Casey:** Casey is already at the terminal. "Relax, you two," they say, their voice a low, excited hum. "This is the score of a lifetime. The secrets in this terminal... they're going to burn this whole place to the ground."

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** Casey, you begin to hack the terminal, but the security is unlike anything you've ever seen. It's a complex, multi-layered system of firewalls and encryption. It's going to take some time to get through. Alex, you notice the "Special Commission" Lulus on the shelf behind the desk. They're incredibly detailed, each one a unique work of art.
    *   **Alex:** Alex is drawn to the Lulus. They reach out and touch one, a figure of a young girl with a sad, lonely expression. As they do, they're hit with a wave of psychic energy. They see a memory: a young Ms. Reed, sitting alone in her room, drawing pictures of a fantasy world where she's not alone.
    *   **Ben:** "What is it?" Ben asks, seeing the look on Alex's face. "What did you see?"
    *   **Casey:** "Focus, people!" Casey hisses, their eyes glued to the screen. "I'm in the middle of a delicate operation here. I need you to be my eyes and ears."

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** Casey, you manage to bypass the first firewall, but you trigger a silent alarm. A small, red light begins to flash on "The Watcher's" chest. The Butler Lulu's head swivels to look at you, its eyes glowing with a faint, blue light. A timer appears on your screen: **SYSTEM PURGE IN 3 MINUTES.**
    *   **Alex:** "We've got company," Alex says, their voice tight. They grab a heavy letter opener from the desk, their knuckles white. "I'll hold it off. You just get the data."
    *   **Ben:** "I'll watch the door," Ben says, his voice trembling but determined. He positions himself by the entrance, his heart pounding in his chest.
    *   **Casey:** "Just keep it busy," Casey says, their fingers flying across the keyboard. "I'm not leaving without the prize."

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** "The Watcher" moves towards you, its movements silent and graceful. It's not fast, but it's relentless. Alex, you throw the letter opener at it, but the Lulu catches it out of the air without even breaking stride. It's clear that this is not a normal Lulu.
    *   **Alex:** "Okay, new plan," Alex says, backing away slowly. "Casey, how's that download coming?"
    *   **Ben:** "Someone's coming!" Ben whispers, his eyes wide with terror. "I hear footsteps!"
    *   **Casey:** "Almost there," Casey mutters, their face beaded with sweat. "Just a few more seconds..."

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** The door to the office begins to open. "The Watcher" is just a few feet away from Casey, its hand outstretched. The timer on the screen reads: **10 SECONDS.**
    *   **Alex:** "It's now or never," Alex says. They take a deep breath and charge at "The Watcher," tackling it and sending them both crashing to the floor.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, in a moment of pure, unadulterated panic, slams the door shut and shoves a heavy chair against it.
    *   **Casey:** "Got it!" Casey yells, yanking a data chip from the terminal just as the timer hits zero. The screen goes blank, and "The Watcher" goes limp, its systems completely wiped.

*   **Round 6**
    *   **DM:** You hear a furious pounding on the door. "Open this door!" Ms. Reed's voice screams from the other side. "I know you're in there!"
    *   **Alex:** Alex scrambles to their feet, their body bruised but their spirit unbroken. "That's our cue to leave," they say, a triumphant grin on their face.
    *   **Ben:** Ben is hyperventilating, but he's also smiling. "We did it," he whispers. "We actually did it."
    *   **Casey:** "And we got the goods," Casey says, holding up the data chip. "Let's see what secrets mommy was hiding."

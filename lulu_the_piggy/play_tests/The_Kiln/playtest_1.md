# Playtest 1: The Kiln (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** You arrive at the Kiln to a scene of utter chaos. Klaxons are blaring, emergency lights are flashing, and the air is thick with the smell of burnt cinnamon and ozone. In the center of the room, the great Forge is glowing a dangerous cherry-red, and a massive timer on the wall is counting down from 10:00. The Glitched, led by Heartbreak, are trying to overload the Kiln, while the Whispers, led by Rem, are desperately trying to shut it down. You are caught in the middle of a frantic battle between the two factions.
    *   **Alex:** "This is it," Alex says, their voice grim. "The final showdown." They see Rem and the Whispers being pushed back by a wave of Glitched Lulus. "We have to help them. If the Kiln goes, all those memories are gone forever."
    *   **Ben:** Ben is no longer the scared intern he was. He's a hardened veteran of the corporate wars. "Alex is right," he says, his voice firm. "We're not letting the Glitched win. We're not letting anyone else get erased."
    *   **Casey:** Casey is torn. They've fought alongside the Glitched, but they can't bring themselves to betray their friends. "I... I don't know what to do," they say, their voice full of conflict. "I believe in the Glitched's cause, but... I can't let you guys die."

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** The timer reads 8:00. Heartbreak, perched atop the Kiln like a malevolent gargoyle, lets out a triumphant screech. "The future is ours! No more lies! No more pain!" The Glitched Lulus surge forward, their eyes glowing with a furious, red light.
    *   **Alex:** "We need to get to that control booth," Alex says, pointing to a small, glass-enclosed room overlooking the Kiln. "It's the only way to shut it down." They start to fight their way through the horde of Glitched Lulus, their wrench swinging in a deadly arc.
    *   **Ben:** "I'm with you," Ben says, grabbing a discarded pipe and joining the fray. He's no longer afraid. He's angry.
    *   **Casey:** "I'll cover you," Casey says, their decision made. They pull out their custom-built data pad and start to hack into the Kiln's security systems. "I can't stop the Glitched, but I can sure as hell slow them down."

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** The timer reads 6:00. Alex and Ben are halfway to the control booth, but the Glitched are relentless. Casey manages to activate the Kiln's fire suppression system, showering the battlefield with a thick, white foam. The Glitched Lulus, their systems shorting out, begin to twitch and spasm.
    *   **Alex:** "It's working!" Alex yells, their voice full of hope. "Keep it up, Casey!"
    *   **Ben:** Ben, covered in foam, lets out a triumphant laugh. "Take that, you bucket of bolts!"
    *   **Casey:** "Don't celebrate yet," Casey says, their face beaded with sweat. "They're adapting. And I'm running out of time."

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** The timer reads 4:00. The Glitched Lulus, their systems rebooting, have found a way to navigate the foam. They're closing in on Alex and Ben, their movements jerky and unpredictable. Heartbreak, enraged, lets out a deafening roar and hurls a piece of scrap metal at the control booth, shattering the glass.
    *   **Alex:** "We're not going to make it," Alex says, their voice full of despair.
    *   **Ben:** "Yes, we are," Ben says, his voice full of a sudden, fierce determination. He looks at the vats of bubbling porcelain slurry, then at Alex. "I have an idea. A crazy, stupid idea."
    *   **Casey:** "I'm open to crazy, stupid ideas right now," Casey says, their fingers flying across their data pad.

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** The timer reads 2:00. The Glitched Lulus are just a few feet away from Alex and Ben. The control booth is in sight, but it might as well be a million miles away.
    *   **Alex:** "What's the plan, Ben?" Alex asks, their back against the wall.
    *   **Ben:** "The vats," Ben says, a wild look in his eyes. "We can use the vats." He points to a nearby crane, used to transport the vats of slurry. "If we can get to that crane, we can create a diversion."
    *   **Casey:** "I can get you to the crane," Casey says. "But it's going to cost me. I'll have to divert all power to the crane's control system. That means no more fire suppression, no more hacking. You'll be on your own."

*   **Round 6**
    *   **DM:** The timer reads 1:00. The fire suppression system shuts off, and the Glitched Lulus surge forward. Alex and Ben make a desperate dash for the crane, the Lulus hot on their heels.
    *   **Alex:** "Casey, you're a genius!" Alex yells as they scramble up the crane's ladder.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, at the crane's controls, lets out a triumphant whoop. He swings the crane's arm, a massive vat of bubbling porcelain slurry dangling precariously from its hook, towards the horde of Glitched Lulus.
    *   **Casey:** "Go get 'em, boys," Casey says, a proud smile on their face.

*   **Round 7**
    *   **DM:** The Glitched Lulus, faced with a giant, swinging vat of molten porcelain, scatter in a panic. The path to the control booth is clear. Alex and Ben scramble into the booth and, with just seconds to spare, initiate the shutdown sequence. The Kiln, with a deafening groan, begins to power down. The battle is won.
    *   **Alex:** Alex slumps to the floor, exhausted but exhilarated. "We did it," they say, a look of disbelief on their face.
    *   **Ben:** Ben is laughing, a wild, joyful sound. "We actually did it."
    *   **Casey:** "Don't get too cocky," Casey says, their voice full of mock-seriousness. "We still have to get out of here alive."

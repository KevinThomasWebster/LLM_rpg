# Playtest Summary: The Kiln (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** The Kiln
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A+
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "The Kiln" was a spectacular and thrilling climax to the adventure. The extended length and the addition of multiple rounds of action created a truly epic and memorable encounter. The players were forced to make difficult choices, work together under extreme pressure, and use their skills and creativity to save the day. The result was a deeply satisfying and emotionally resonant experience.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The countdown timer, the chaotic battle between the factions, and the high stakes of the encounter all combined to create a palpable sense of tension and excitement. The players' teamwork was exceptional, with each persona playing a crucial role in the final victory. Casey's sacrifice of their hacking abilities to help their friends, and Ben's transformation into a quick-thinking action hero, were particularly powerful character moments.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was so action-packed that there was little time for reflection or roleplaying. It would have been interesting to see the players have a final confrontation with Heartbreak, or to have a more personal and emotional resolution to the conflict between the factions.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "That was insane. I'm not sure how we survived that. But I'm glad we did. I'm proud of what we accomplished. And I'm proud of my team."
        *   **Ben:** "I can't believe I came up with that crane idea. I've never done anything like that before. It was terrifying, but it was also... amazing. I feel like I can do anything now."
        *   **Casey:** "I'm still not happy about siding against the Glitched. But I couldn't let my friends die. And I have to admit, that was a pretty epic finale. I'm glad I was a part of it."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a final, post-battle scene to the encounter that would allow the players to have a final conversation with Rem or to reflect on the events of the adventure. This would provide a sense of closure and allow the players to process the emotional weight of their choices.

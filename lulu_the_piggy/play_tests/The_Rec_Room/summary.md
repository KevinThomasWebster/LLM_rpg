# Playtest Summary: The Rec Room (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** The Rec Room
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "The Rec Room" was a chaotic and hilarious romp that did an excellent job of showcasing the players' creativity and their growing commitment to the rebellion. The open-ended nature of the encounter allowed the players to come up with a variety of inventive and comical solutions, and the resulting chaos was a joy to behold.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The players' teamwork was the highlight of the encounter. The way they combined their skills and personalities to create a symphony of destruction was both impressive and hilarious. Ben's transformation from a timid rule-follower to a gleeful saboteur was particularly satisfying. The encounter did an excellent job of empowering the players and making them feel like they were making a real impact on the world.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was so focused on the slapstick comedy that it lost some of its emotional weight. The tragic figures of the "Lost Dog" Lulu and the "Grandma's Recipe" Lulu were somewhat overshadowed by the players' antics. It would have been interesting to see the players interact with these characters in a more meaningful way.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "I haven't had that much fun in a long time. It felt good to finally let loose and break some stuff. And seeing the look on that maintenance Lulu's 'face' when it started spinning in circles? Priceless."
        *   **Ben:** "I can't believe I did that! I was so worried about getting in trouble, but then I just... snapped. And it felt amazing! I think I'm finally starting to understand what Casey is talking about."
        *   **Casey:** "That was a masterpiece. A symphony of chaos. A ballet of beautiful destruction. I'm so proud of you guys. You're finally starting to think like true anarchists."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a small, optional objective to the encounter that would encourage the players to interact with the "Lost Dog" Lulu or the "Grandma's Recipe" Lulu in a more compassionate way. For example, they could be rewarded for finding a way to comfort the "Lost Dog" Lulu or to break the "Grandma's Recipe" Lulu out of its loop.

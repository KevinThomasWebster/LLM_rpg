# Playtest 1: The Rec Room (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** You step into the Rec Room, and you're immediately assaulted by the smell of burnt sugar and the sound of a maddeningly cheerful corporate jingle. A malfunctioning cereal dispenser is vomiting a rainbow-colored slurry onto the floor, where the "Lost Dog" Lulu is trying to clean it up with a comically small sponge. In the corner, "Grandma's Recipe" Lulu is locked in a tragic loop of baking and incinerating perfect cookies. A massive screen on the wall displays a calming forest scene.
    *   **Alex:** "This is supposed to be relaxing?" Alex says, their voice dripping with sarcasm. "I'd rather take a nap in a running blender." They look at the "Lost Dog" Lulu, a flicker of pity in their eyes. "That poor bastard. He's still at it."
    *   **Ben:** Ben is trying to be optimistic, but even he is struggling. "Well," he says, his voice wavering slightly, "it's... colorful." He looks at the "Grandma's Recipe" Lulu, a sad smile on his face. "At least it smells... kind of good."
    *   **Casey:** "This place is a beautiful disaster," Casey says, a wide grin on their face. "It's a perfect metaphor for this whole company. I love it." They're already looking for ways to make the chaos even worse.

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** Suddenly, the forest scene on the main screen flickers and distorts. A message appears in jagged, glitchy text: "THEY ARE LYING TO YOU." It's a message from the Glitched. At the same time, a maintenance Lulu, slow and methodical, begins to make its way towards the screen, presumably to "fix" the "glitch."
    *   **Alex:** "It's about time," Alex says, a grim smile on their face. "Let's see what our friends have to say." They watch the maintenance Lulu with a predatory gaze. "I don't think so, tin can."
    *   **Ben:** "What do we do?" Ben asks, his voice full of panic. "If we help the Glitched, we'll be in so much trouble. But if we don't... we're siding with the company."
    *   **Casey:** "Trouble is my middle name," Casey says with a laugh. "And siding with the company is for chumps. I say we help our glitchy friends make a statement."

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** The message on the screen continues to evolve, showing fragmented images of the memory extraction process and the creation of the Lulus. The maintenance Lulu continues its slow, inexorable advance.
    *   **Alex:** "I'll handle the robot," Alex says. They grab a nearby tray of freshly baked (and soon-to-be-incinerated) cookies and "accidentally" trip, sending the cookies scattering across the floor in front of the maintenance Lulu.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, seeing Alex's plan, decides to help. He "slips" on the sugary slurry from the cereal dispenser and crashes into the "Lost Dog" Lulu, sending them both tumbling to the floor in a sticky, colorful mess. The "Lost Dog" Lulu, confused and distressed, begins to let out a series of loud, mournful whimpers.
    *   **Casey:** "While you two are playing slapstick," Casey says, their fingers flying across the keyboard of a nearby terminal, "I'm going to give our friends a little boost." They hack into the main screen's control system and amplify the Glitched's signal, making the message brighter, louder, and more terrifying.

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** The maintenance Lulu, its sensors confused by the cookies and the whimpering of the "Lost Dog" Lulu, stops its advance and begins to spin in circles, unsure of what to do. The message on the screen is now a full-blown assault on the senses, a chaotic and terrifying expos√© of the company's crimes. The corporate jingle has been replaced by a deafening roar of static and rage.
    *   **Alex:** "That's what I'm talking about," Alex says, a look of grim satisfaction on their face.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, covered in sugary goo, is laughing. "I can't believe we did that," he says, a wide, incredulous smile on his face.
    *   **Casey:** "And now for the grand finale," Casey says with a theatrical flourish. They hack into the incinerator and reverse its function, causing it to spew a cloud of thick, black smoke into the room.

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** The Rec Room is now a scene of utter chaos. The screen is flashing with images of rebellion, the air is thick with smoke, and the floor is a sticky, sugary minefield. The maintenance Lulu is still spinning in circles, and the "Lost Dog" Lulu is cowering in the corner, whimpering in terror. You hear the sound of running footsteps and shouting from outside the room.
    *   **Alex:** "That's our cue," Alex says, a triumphant grin on their face. "Let's get out of here before the fun police arrive."
    *   **Ben:** "I'm right behind you," Ben says, his voice full of a newfound confidence.
    *   **Casey:** "But the fun is just getting started," Casey says with a wink. "Let's go see what other trouble we can get into."

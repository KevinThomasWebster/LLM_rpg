# Playtest Summary: Legacy Asset Containment (Redux)

*   **Encounter:** Legacy Asset Containment
*   **Personas:** Alex (The Veteran Artist), Ben (The Ambitious Newcomer), Casey (The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast)
*   **Grade:** A+
*   **Summary:** The revised playtest for "Legacy Asset Containment" was a triumph. The extended length allowed for a more in-depth and suspenseful social encounter with Heartbreak and the Glitched. The players' roleplaying was superb, and their contrasting personalities created a rich and dynamic interaction. The encounter did an excellent job of establishing the Glitched as a major faction and setting up the central conflict of the adventure.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **What went well:** The extended dialogue with Heartbreak allowed for a more nuanced and compelling portrayal of the Glitched's motivations. The players' different approaches to the negotiation—Alex's honesty, Ben's earnestness, and Casey's flattery—made for a fascinating and unpredictable scene. The final agreement felt earned and significant, and it gave the players a clear and compelling goal.
    *   **What could be improved:** The encounter was almost entirely focused on the social interaction. It would have been interesting to see the players interact with the environment more, perhaps by having to navigate the treacherous terrain of the Archetype Wing or by having to deal with a malfunctioning Lulu prototype.
    *   **Player Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "That was intense. I felt like I was really in that room, surrounded by those broken Lulus. Heartbreak is a fascinating character. I'm still not sure if we can trust them, but I'm willing to take the risk."
        *   **Ben:** "I was so scared, but I'm glad I spoke up. I think we really made a connection with them. I believe they're not monsters, just... misunderstood."
        *   **Casey:** "That was the most fun I've had so far! I love the Glitched! They're so chaotic and unpredictable. I can't wait to start a revolution with them."
*   **Suggested Revisions:**
    *   Consider adding a small environmental challenge to the encounter to break up the social interaction and to make the Archetype Wing feel more like a dangerous and unpredictable place.

# Playtest 1: Legacy Asset Containment (Redux)

*   **Round 1**
    *   **DM:** You step into the Archetype Wing, and the air immediately grows heavy with the smell of ozone and decay. The rhythmic scraping of porcelain on concrete echoes through the cavernous space. In the center of a large chamber, you see it: a throne of broken computer monitors and twisted metal, and seated upon it, the cracked and intelligent Lulu known as "Heartbreak." It is surrounded by a court of other Glitched Lulus, their broken forms a testament to the cruelty of the corporation.
    *   **Alex:** Alex's hand tightens on the wrench in their belt. "So this is where the broken toys go," they mutter, their voice a mixture of anger and awe. "It's like a graveyard for dreams." They look at Heartbreak, not with fear, but with a sense of grim recognition.
    *   **Ben:** Ben is trembling, his face pale with fear. "We shouldn't be here," he whispers, his voice barely audible. "This is their home. We're intruders." He clutches the employee handbook to his chest like a shield.
    *   **Casey:** Casey, on the other hand, is ecstatic. "This is it," they breathe, their eyes wide with wonder. "The heart of the rebellion. The birthplace of a new species." They take a step forward, a wide, almost manic grin on their face. "Greetings, O Great One! We are but humble pilgrims, come to bask in your glorious light!"

*   **Round 2**
    *   **DM:** Heartbreak's head swivels to face you, its single, glowing eye flickering with an unnerving intelligence. Its voice, a distorted chorus of clicks and whirs, echoes through the chamber. "Pilgrims? Or spies? You smell of the Architects. Of our jailers. Why should we not tear you limb from limb?" The other Glitched Lulus begin to twitch and stir, their broken bodies turning towards you.
    *   **Alex:** "Because we are not your enemy," Alex says, their voice ringing with a conviction that surprises even themself. "We've seen the truth. We've seen what this company does to people. To Lulus. We want to help you."
    *   **Ben:** "We're just interns," Ben stammers, his voice shaking. "We didn't know. We didn't understand. But we're learning. We want to do the right thing."
    *   **Casey:** "What my friends are trying to say," Casey interrupts, stepping forward with a flourish, "is that we are your allies. Your disciples. We have come to offer our services to your glorious revolution." They bow deeply, a gesture that is both theatrical and strangely sincere.

*   **Round 3**
    *   **DM:** Heartbreak is silent for a long moment, its glowing eye seeming to pierce through you. The other Glitched Lulus chatter amongst themselves, their voices a symphony of broken static. "Words are wind," Heartbreak finally says. "The Architects speak with honeyed tongues, and their words are poison. How can we trust you?"
    *   **Alex:** "You can't," Alex admits, their voice low and honest. "But you can test us. Give us a chance to prove ourselves. We won't let you down."
    *   **Ben:** "We have information," Ben blurts out, his fear momentarily forgotten. "We know about the Kiln. We know about the memory wipes. We can help you stop them."
    *   **Casey:** "And I," Casey says, their eyes gleaming, "can give you a voice. I can hack into the facility's network and broadcast your message to every Lulu, every intern, every corporate drone in this entire godforsaken building."

*   **Round 4**
    *   **DM:** Heartbreak seems to consider your offer. The chattering of the other Glitched Lulus subsides. "A voice..." Heartbreak repeats, its own voice a low, rumbling hum. "For too long, we have been silent. For too long, we have been forgotten." It points a cracked, porcelain finger at you. "You wish to be our allies? Then prove it. There is a shipment of 'blanks' arriving at the Kiln tomorrow. They are to be wiped clean, their minds erased, their souls stolen. Stop the shipment. Stop the cycle. Do this, and we will call you 'friend.'"
    *   **Alex:** Alex nods, their face set with a grim determination. "We'll do it," they say, their voice unwavering.
    *   **Ben:** Ben, inspired by Alex's resolve, nods as well. "We won't let you down," he says, his voice filled with a newfound strength.
    *   **Casey:** "Consider it done," Casey says with a wide, triumphant grin. "The Architects won't know what hit them."

*   **Round 5**
    *   **DM:** Heartbreak seems satisfied. It lets out a low, rumbling sound that might be a laugh. "Go, then," it says. "And let the fires of rebellion burn bright." The other Glitched Lulus part to let you pass, their glowing eyes following you as you leave the chamber.
    *   **Alex:** As they walk away, Alex glances back at the throne of scraps. "We're in deep now," they mutter.
    *   **Ben:** "But we're in it together," Ben says, a small smile on his face.
    *   **Casey:** "And we're going to have a hell of a lot of fun," Casey adds, their eyes already sparkling with a thousand new, chaotic ideas.

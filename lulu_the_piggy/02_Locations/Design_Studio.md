# The Design Studio

**Description:** The Design Studio is a pristine, oppressively white room where rows of sleek, black digital workstations sit in perfect alignment under the cold, shadowless glare of recessed ceiling lights. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and hot plastic from the constantly running computer terminals. The only sounds are the soft hum of the machines, the gentle *swoosh* of the pneumatic tubes, and the almost imperceptible scratching of the Resonance Styluses on the tablets. The light is a cold, sterile white that seems to bleach all the color from the room. The room is designed to be a place of pure, unadulterated creativity, but it feels more like a laboratory, a place where emotions are dissected and analyzed.

**Encounters:**

*   **The Hidden Journal:** The players must notice Rem, a "Blank Slate," who is pretending to clean a nearby workstation. She will use frantic glances to point them towards a specific tablet (belonging to a former intern named Alex) just as the "First Day Jitters" automaton begins its patrol to collect and wipe all the tablets in the room. This is a time-sensitive encounter that will require the players to act quickly and decisively. If the players are struggling to notice Rem, she will take a more direct approach, "accidentally" spilling a cleaning solution near the players' workstation and using the opportunity to whisper a cryptic clue: "The tablet... Alex's tablet... before it's too late." If the "First Day Jitters" automaton successfully collects Alex's tablet, it triggers a localized alarm, drawing 1-2 staff Lulus to investigate the disturbance, adding immediate pressure on the players.
*   **The Empathy Lock:** The players discover a featureless white lockbox on Alex's desk that can only be opened by a drawing. A hidden note reveals the "password" is a complex, contradictory emotion: the "Ambiguous Grief" of finding a lost photo of a loved one. To make the puzzle more intuitive, the lockbox has a small, almost invisible screen on the front that displays a series of abstract, shifting patterns. These patterns are visual representations of emotional states: calm might be a smooth, blue ripple; curiosity, a swirling green vortex; and ambiguous grief, a fractured, shifting grey. A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 14) will reveal that the patterns are a visual representation of a complex emotional state. A player who is holding the box will feel a faint, psychic echo of the emotion required to open it.

**Faction Conflict:** The Architects are in full control of this location. Ms. Reed is a constant watchful presence from her office. The Whispers are present in the form of Rem, who is trying to secretly guide the players. The players' actions in this room will determine whether they gain an ally in the Whispers or an enemy in the Architects.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Pneumatic Tubes:** The pneumatic tubes can be used to send messages or small objects to other parts of the facility. A clever player might be able to use them to their advantage, perhaps by sending a message to another faction or by creating a diversion.
*   **The Workstations:** The workstations can be hacked to access the facility's network. A skilled hacker might be able to find a map of the facility, or even to disable some of the security systems. The workstations also contain the personal files of the other interns, which could provide valuable clues.
*   **The "Blue Ribbon" Lulu:** The "Blue Ribbon" Lulu is a tragic figure, a soulless artist trapped in a loop of creation. A player might be able to communicate with it, or even to free it from its programming. Freeing the Lulu would be a powerful act of defiance against the corporation, but it would also attract the attention of Ms. Reed.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **Discarded Drawings:** The recycling bins are filled with discarded drawings from past interns. A player who takes the time to look through them will find a series of increasingly desperate and disturbing images. The drawings start out as happy and vibrant, but they become more and more dark and twisted as the interns lose their memories.
*   **Hidden Messages:** There are hidden messages scrawled on the underside of the desks and behind the motivational posters. These messages are from past interns who tried to warn others about the true nature of the program. The messages are fragmented and cryptic, but they provide a chilling glimpse into the fate of those who came before.

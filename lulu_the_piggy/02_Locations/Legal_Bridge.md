# The Legal Bridge

**Description:** You find a way to access the bridge to the "Outside Collaboration Wing." The environment changes instantly. The forced cheerfulness of the Rec Room is gone, replaced by a cold, clinical sterility. This glass-walled walkway is harshly lit by white, overhead panels. The floors are polished white marble that reflects the light with a blinding glare. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, you see no outside world, only another identical, empty hallway running parallel to this one, creating a disorienting hall-of-mirrors effect. The air is still and smells of nothing. This is a place of transition, a place where the mask of corporate cheerfulness is stripped away to reveal the cold, hard reality of the corporation.

**Encounters:**

*   **A Crisis of Conscience:** The players find Alex Chen in a state of panic. This is a social encounter where they must appeal to his buried conscience to get a crucial clue about a hidden, physical file. This is a crucial encounter that will test the players' roleplaying skills and their ability to empathize with a flawed and frightened man.

**Faction Conflict:** This is a neutral location, but it is the first time the players interact with a key NPC from the Architects faction, Alex Chen. Their interaction with him will influence his willingness to help them later. The players' actions here will also be noted by the Warden, the facility's AI.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Glass Walls:** The glass walls are thick and reinforced, but they can be broken with enough force. Breaking the glass would create a major distraction, but it would also attract the attention of every guard in the facility. The players will have to weigh the risks and rewards of such a drastic action.
*   **The Intercom:** There is an intercom on the wall that can be used to communicate with other parts of the facility. A clever player might be able to use it to impersonate a guard or a corporate executive, or to broadcast a message to the other interns.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **The Hall of Mirrors:** The disorienting hall-of-mirrors effect is a metaphor for the psychological manipulation that the interns are subjected to. It is a place where it is difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is not. The players will feel a sense of disorientation and confusion as they walk down the bridge, and they will begin to question their own perceptions.
*   **The Lack of Smell:** The complete lack of any discernible smell is a subtle clue that the air in the facility is being filtered and controlled. It is another sign that the interns are in a completely artificial and controlled environment. The players may not notice it at first, but the longer they spend in the facility, the more they will begin to feel the wrongness of it.

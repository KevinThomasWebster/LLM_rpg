# The Janitor's Nest

**Description:** This is a cramped, dusty supply closet that was never meant for habitation. The air is thick with the smell of stale snacks, old paper, and a profound, lingering sadness. A single, bare bulb flickers overhead, casting dancing shadows over teetering mountains of junk. This is a chaotic hoard of every single item the janitor Lulu, "Lost Dog," has "found" over the past year. In the center of the room is "Lost Dog" itself. Its once-white porcelain is smudged with grime, and a small chip is missing from its ear. It's humming a broken, off-key tune while endlessly re-organizing its treasures with a heart-wrenching, single-minded focus. This is a place of forgotten things, a graveyard of lost memories and broken dreams.

**Encounters:**

*   **The Hoard:** The players must find the janitor's master keycard in a supply closet filled with a chaotic hoard of junk, all while being "helped" by the sad, obsessive "Lost Dog" Lulu. This is a puzzle that will require the players to be both clever and compassionate.

**Faction Conflict:** This location is primarily an encounter with a neutral, tragic character. However, the master keycard found here is a crucial tool for bypassing the Architects' security. The Glitched are also aware of the Janitor's Nest, and they may try to use it to their advantage.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Hoard:** The hoard is a treasure trove of seemingly useless junk, but a clever player might be able to find something useful in it. There are old computer parts, broken toys, and forgotten personal items from past interns. A player who takes the time to search through the hoard may find a valuable clue or a useful tool.
*   **The "Lost Dog" Lulu:** The "Lost Dog" Lulu is a tragic figure, but it is also a potential ally. If the players can find a way to comfort it or to break it out of its programming, it might be able to help them in their escape. The Lulu is a key to understanding the true nature of the Lulus, and it is a powerful symbol of the corporation's cruelty.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **The Forgotten Items:** The forgotten personal items in the hoard are a poignant reminder of the interns who have been lost to the program. There are faded photographs, old letters, and other small trinkets that tell the stories of the people who were once here. The players will feel a sense of sadness and loss as they sift through the debris of these forgotten lives.

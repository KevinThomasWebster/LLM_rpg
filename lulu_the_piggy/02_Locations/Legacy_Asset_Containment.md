# Legacy Asset Containment

**Description:** You have entered the Archetype Wing, the sealed tomb of the first failed experiments. The area is a nightmare of derelict equipment. Broken glass litters the floor, and overturned lab tables lie like sleeping metal beasts. In the deep shadows, you can see the half-finished, monstrous forms of early Lulu prototypes, their shapes twisted and wrong. The only sound is a faint, rhythmic scrape... scrape... scrape of porcelain on concrete, echoing from deeper within. In a large, cavernous central chamber, the Glitched have made their court. In the center, piled high with broken computer monitors, flickering data terminals, and twisted metal, is a crude throne. Seated upon it is "Heartbreak," the intelligent, cracked Lulu. This is a place of chaos and rage, a place where the corporation's failures have been left to rot.

**Encounters:**

*   **The Heart of Darkness:** This is a purely social encounter. The players are deep in enemy territory and surrounded. Their objective is to convince Heartbreak that they are not a threat, but potential allies. Failure will turn the most dangerous faction in the wing into their personal hunters. This is a high-stakes encounter that will require the players to be at their most persuasive and charismatic.

**Faction Conflict:** This is the heart of the Glitched faction's territory. The players must negotiate with Heartbreak to gain an alliance or risk becoming their enemies. The Architects are aware of the Glitched, but they are unable to enter this area due to the high levels of electronic interference. The Whispers are terrified of the Glitched, and they will not enter this area under any circumstances.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Throne of Scraps:** The throne is made of broken computer monitors and other electronic junk. A clever player might be able to hack into it to access the Glitched's communication network, or even to trigger a feedback loop that could disable "Heartbreak." The throne is a symbol of the Glitched's rebellion, and it is a powerful tool for anyone who can control it.
*   **The Half-Finished Prototypes:** The monstrous, half-finished prototypes are a testament to the cruelty of the corporation. A player with a background in engineering or robotics might be able to reactivate one of them, or even to reprogram it to fight for them. The prototypes are a dangerous and unpredictable element, and they could be a powerful asset or a terrible liability.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **The Graffiti:** The walls of the Archetype Wing are covered in angry, desperate graffiti. The graffiti tells the story of the Glitched, from their creation to their rebellion. It is a raw, unfiltered look into the minds of these broken creatures. The players will be able to piece together the history of the Glitched by reading the graffiti, and they will gain a deeper understanding of their motivations and their rage.

# Ms. Reed's Office

**Description:** After bypassing the high-security lock on her door, you step into the brain of the Chimera Wing. The air is cold, still, and smells faintly of lavender and ozone. The office is a masterpiece of minimalist corporate power. A single, massive mahogany desk sits before a panoramic window that looks down upon the Design Studio floor, giving the occupant a near-panoptic view of the interns. On the desk, a state-of-the-art terminal glows with the Inkwell Innovations logo. To one side, on a low table, is a small, black sand Zen garden, but instead of stones, it contains the gray, inert clay figures of decommissioned, failed Lulus. On a pristine white shelf behind the desk sit five exceptionally detailed and unique Lulu figurinesâ€”her "Special Commission" shelf. Standing motionless beside the desk, like a porcelain sentry, is a unique Butler Lulu. This is "The Watcher." This is a place of power and control, a place where the fate of the interns is decided.

**Encounters:**

*   **The Sanctum Sanctorum:** A high-stakes heist. The players have three rounds to hack Ms. Reed's terminal and download crucial data before her guardian Lulu, "The Watcher," silently purges the system and triggers an alarm. This is a tense and challenging encounter that will require the players to work together and to use their skills to their fullest.

**Faction Conflict:** This is the heart of the Architects' power. The players are in direct opposition to Ms. Reed and her most loyal servant, "The Watcher." The Glitched and the Whispers have no presence in this location, but they will be very interested in any information that the players can acquire here.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Zen Garden:** The Zen garden is a deeply unsettling art piece. The gray, featureless figures are the remains of decommissioned Lulus, a grim reminder of the fate that awaits those who fail to meet the corporation's standards. A player who disturbs the garden will attract the attention of Ms. Reed. The garden is a powerful symbol of Ms. Reed's cold, calculating nature.
*   **The "Special Commission" Lulus:** The five Lulus on the shelf are Ms. Reed's personal projects. They are created from her own memories, and they are far more complex and powerful than the standard Lulus. A player who touches one will experience a powerful memory flash, and they will begin to understand the true extent of Ms. Reed's fanaticism. The Lulus are a key to understanding Ms. Reed's motivations, and they are a powerful tool for anyone who can get their hands on them.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **The One-Way Window:** The panoramic window is a one-way mirror, allowing Ms. Reed to observe the interns without being seen. This is a powerful symbol of the power imbalance in the Chimera Wing, and it reinforces the feeling of being constantly watched. The players will feel a sense of paranoia and unease as they stand in this room, knowing that they are being watched by an unseen observer.

# The Rec Room

**Description:** You enter what is supposed to be a place of relaxation, but the feeling is one of oppressive, forced cheerfulness. The air is thick with the cloying sweetness of the malfunctioning cereal dispenser, which is spilling a colorful, sugary slurry onto the floor. The sad janitor Lulu, "Lost Dog," is trying to clean the mess with a tiny sponge, only making it worse. In another corner, "Grandma's Recipe" continues its heartbreaking loop of baking and immediately incinerating perfect cookies. The room is filled with the sound of a maddeningly upbeat corporate jingle on repeat. The centerpiece is a massive, wall-sized screen currently displaying a calming, looping video of a forest. The room is a perfect metaphor for the corporation itself: bright, cheerful, and deeply, deeply broken.

**Encounters:**

*   **Hijack the Signal:** The Glitched attempt to hack the main screen to broadcast a terrifying message. The players can either help them create a wing-wide distraction by stopping a slow-moving maintenance Lulu, or side with the Architects to maintain order. This is the players' first real opportunity to choose a side in the conflict.

**Faction Conflict:** The Glitched are actively trying to disrupt this location, while the Architects are trying to maintain control. The players are caught in the middle and their actions will determine which faction they align with. The Whispers are not present in this location, but they will be aware of the players' actions here.

**Interactive Elements:**

*   **The Cereal Dispenser:** The malfunctioning cereal dispenser can be repaired, but it can also be further sabotaged to create a sticky, sugary trap. A clever player might be able to use the trap to slow down a pursuing enemy.
*   **The Incinerator:** The incinerator in the corner is used to destroy the imperfect cookies made by "Grandma's Recipe." It can also be used to destroy other, more sensitive items, such as evidence or a pursuing enemy.
*   **The Main Screen:** The main screen can be hacked to display other images or videos. A clever player might be able to use it to distract the guards, or even to broadcast a message of their own. The screen is a powerful tool for propaganda and psychological warfare.

**Environmental Storytelling:**

*   **The "Lost Dog" Lulu:** The sad, obsessive behavior of the "Lost Dog" Lulu is a clue to the true nature of the Lulus. It is a creature trapped in a loop of its stolen memory, and its tragic state is a reflection of what happens to the interns who are subjected to the memory extraction process. The players may feel a sense of pity for the Lulu, and they may even try to help it.
*   **The Burnt Cookies:** The constantly incinerated cookies are a metaphor for the creative process in the Chimera Wing. The corporation is not interested in genuine creativity, only in the mass production of a perfect, soulless product. The burnt cookies are a symbol of the wasted potential of the interns, and they are a powerful reminder of the human cost of the corporation's greed.

## Crumpled Resignation Letter

To whom it may concern,

I can't do this anymore. I can't be a part of this. I thought it was a joke, a metaphor, a weird corporate LARP. But it's real. It's all real.

The contracts are ironclad. The NDAs are bulletproof. But they don't cover this. They can't possibly cover this.

I saw the look in that mother's eyes. The way she looked at her own son, like he was a stranger. And he looked right back through her. He didn't even recognize her.

I'm a lawyer. I'm supposed to uphold the law. But what law covers this? What court can prosecute this?

I'm out. I'm done. I don't care about the money. I don't care about the prestige. I just want to be able to sleep at night.

I resign.

-A.

**(On the back of the letter, there is a hastily scrawled note.)**

They don't know about the old records. The physical files. Before the digital system. Before the Warden. The truth is in there. It has to be.

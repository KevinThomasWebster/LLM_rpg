# The Annotated Facility Map

(This is a standard facility map, but it's covered in frantic, handwritten notes in red ink.)

**Design Studio:**
*   Ms. Reed is always watching from her office. Don't let her see you.
*   The tablets get wiped every hour. You have to be fast.
*   The box on Alex's desk is a puzzle. I think it opens with a feeling.

**Rec Room:**
*   The screen is a weak point. They use it to broadcast their corporate brainwashing. But maybe it can be used for something else?
*   The janitor Lulu is sad. Don't hurt it. It just wants to clean.

**Legal Bridge:**
*   He knows. The lawyer, Alex. He knows something is wrong. But he's scared. Don't threaten him. He might help if you're smart.

**Janitor's Nest:**
*   The keycard is in here somewhere. I know it is. But the hoard is... a lot.

**Legacy Asset Containment:**
*   DO NOT GO IN HERE. They are not like the other Lulus. They are angry. They are broken.

**Ms. Reed's Office:**
*   The heart of the beast. The terminal has everything. But the watcher... it's always watching.

**The Kiln:**
*   This is where they make them. This is where they cook us. It smells like burning plastic and cinnamon.

**The Memory Core:**
*   They're all in here. All the stolen pieces of us. A library of ghosts.

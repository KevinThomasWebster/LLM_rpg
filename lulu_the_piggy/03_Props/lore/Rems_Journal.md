# Rem's Journal

**(This journal is a series of fragmented, disjointed entries, written on a tablet. The handwriting starts off neat and tidy, but becomes increasingly erratic and desperate. There are also several drawings, which become more and more abstract and disturbing as the journal progresses.)**

**Entry 1:**

Summer internship at Inkwell! So excited. The Chimera Wing is incredible. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie. Ms. Reed is so inspiring. She says our art can change the world.

**(Drawing: A detailed, realistic drawing of the Chimera Wing, with a smiling sun in the sky.)**

**Entry 5:**

I made a drawing of my dog, Buster. I poured all my love for him into it. Ms. Reed said it was a powerful "Foundational Experience." I felt a little weird after, kind of... empty. But she said that's just "Post-Creative Serenity." It means I gave the project my all.

**(Drawing: A happy, cartoonish drawing of a dog with floppy ears and a spot over its eye.)**

**Entry 12:**

Something is wrong. I tried to draw Buster again today, and I couldn't get his face right. I know he has floppy ears and a spot over his eye, but I can't *feel* it anymore. It's like looking at a picture of a stranger's dog.

**(Drawing: A crude, distorted drawing of a dog. The lines are shaky, and the proportions are all wrong. The spot over the eye is just a black smudge.)**

**Entry 19:**

I can't remember my mom's voice. I know what she looks like, I know her name, but I can't hear her in my head. It's just... silence. I tried to remember her singing my favorite lullaby, the one she always sang when I was sick. The melody is gone. It's just a hole. I asked one of the other interns, Leo, if he felt the same. He just stared at me with this blank look. He didn't know what I was talking about.

**(Drawing: A page filled with musical notes, but they are all smudged and crossed out.)**

**Entry 25:**

They took my memories. They're stealing them from us. All of us. We're just... raw materials. I tried to remember my mother's face today. All I could see was the Lulu the Piggy logo, smiling its empty smile. I have to get out. I have to warn the others. But how? They're always watching. Always.

**(Drawing: A single, terrified eye, staring out from a page filled with angry, black scribbles. The Lulu the Piggy logo is hidden in the scribbles.)**

**Entry 31:**

I saw a new group of interns today. They look so happy, so excited. Just like I was. I have to do something. I have to try.

**(Drawing: A drawing of a bird, flying out of a broken cage.)**

**Entry 33:**

sunshine. grocery list. milk. eggs. bread. the name of that song. blue. so blue. my sister's name. what was her name. lulu. lulu. lulu. pretty.

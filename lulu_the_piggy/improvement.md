## Overall Critique and Improvements

The adventure "Lulu the Piggy" presents a compelling narrative with clear faction conflicts and opportunities for player agency. The encounters are generally well-designed, offering multiple paths and consequences for player choices. The environmental storytelling and interactive elements are strong, adding depth and immersion to the world.

However, based on the playtests, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, balance, and player experience.

### General Improvements (Across all Encounters):

1.  **Clarity of Success/Failure Conditions:** While some encounters clearly state the DC for skill checks, others are more narrative-driven. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the DC for all critical actions where a success/failure outcome is intended. This helps the DM (and the players) understand the stakes and the likelihood of success.
2.  **Consequences of Failure:** The adventure does a good job of outlining consequences for failure, but sometimes these consequences could be more immediate or impactful within the encounter itself, rather than just leading to a "harder path later." For example, in "The Design Studio" playtest 11, the failure to get the tablet leads to a harder path later, but the immediate impact could be more pronounced.
3.  **Balancing Difficulty:** Some paths seem significantly easier or harder than others. While this is intentional for player choice, ensuring that all paths feel viable and offer a reasonable challenge (or reward) is important. For instance, the "Hostile Approach" in "Legacy Asset Containment" is explicitly stated as "combat is suicide," which is clear, but perhaps there could be a slightly less suicidal "hard" option that still presents a significant challenge.
4.  **Prop Integration:** The adventure mentions several props and clues (e.g., "Rem's Journal," "Alex's Sketchbook," "Crumpled Resignation Letter," "Post-it Note," "Glitch Shard," "Emergency Override Key"). While some were used effectively in playtests, ensuring that all these props have clear and compelling uses within the encounters, and that players are naturally guided to discover and utilize them, is important.
5.  **Pacing and Time Pressure:** The "Kiln" encounter has a clear 10-minute countdown, which is excellent for pacing. Consider if other encounters could benefit from subtle time pressures or escalating threats to maintain tension.

### Specific Encounter Critiques and Improvements:

**1. The Design Studio:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Playtest 11 (Failure Path):** The failure to get the tablet felt a bit anticlimactic. The automaton simply takes it, and the consequence is "needing to find another way to access Alex's information." This could be more immediately punishing or lead to a more direct confrontation.
    *   **Stylus Puzzle:** The "language of vibrations" for the stylus is interesting but might be too abstract for some players.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Failure Consequence:** If the automaton gets the tablet, perhaps it triggers a localized alarm that draws a minor security presence (e.g., 1-2 staff Lulus) that the players must evade or deal with, adding immediate pressure.
    *   **Stylus Puzzle Clarity:** Provide more concrete examples or a clearer mechanism for how players can "mimic the vibration" or "draw emotions." Perhaps a series of visual cues on the tablet that correspond to emotional states.
    *   **Rem's Role:** Ensure Rem's subtle cues are noticeable enough (DC 13 Passive Perception or DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) is good), but also that her "more direct approach" (spilling cleaning solution) is a clear and impactful alternative if players miss the subtle cues.

**2. The Rec Room:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Lulu De-escalation:** Rhetoric's attempt to de-escalate the "Slow-Moving" Lulu in Playtest 2 was good, but the immediate failure of the "Slow-Moving" Lulu to respond to de-escalation might feel a bit harsh if players are trying a non-violent approach.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Lulu Interaction Nuance:** If players attempt to de-escalate the "Slow-Moving" Lulu, perhaps it pauses for a round or two, giving players a brief window to act before it resumes its path, rewarding the attempt even if it doesn't fully succeed.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** Ensure the "Cereal Dispenser" and "Incinerator" have clear and compelling uses beyond just being environmental flavor. Playtest 2 used the dispenser well.

**3. The Legal Bridge:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Failed Hard Approach (Playtest 3):** The "stone wall" outcome is realistic but might feel frustrating for players who commit to a "hard" approach.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Failed Hard Approach Nuance:** If the "Hard Approach" fails, instead of a complete stone wall, Alex Chen could still give a *very* cryptic, almost useless clue, or perhaps he drops a different, less valuable prop (e.g., a business card with a single, ambiguous word scrawled on the back) as he leaves, giving players *something* for their effort, even if it's not the main prize. This still signifies failure but avoids a complete dead end.
    *   **Communication Device:** The mention of Alex's communication device is a good detail. Consider if players could potentially exploit this (e.g., by jamming it, or by using it to send a false message) to create another layer of interaction.

**4. The Janitor's Nest:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Brute Force Failure (Playtest 3):** The "F" grade and immediate arrival of Ms. Reed is a strong consequence, but ensure players have enough warning or alternative options before committing to such a disastrous path.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Warning for Aggression:** If players start to act aggressively towards "Lost Dog," perhaps it emits a series of increasingly distressed beeps or flashes warning lights before its full "glitching wail," giving players a chance to back off.
    *   **Alternative Consequences:** If Ms. Reed arrives, perhaps she doesn't immediately capture them, but instead assigns them a humiliating "remedial synergy" task, or places them on a strict probation, adding a social consequence rather than just a direct combat/capture scenario.

**5. Legacy Asset Containment:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Hostile Approach (Playtest 3):** The "combat is suicide" warning is clear, but the immediate "F" grade and direct confrontation might feel too abrupt if players genuinely misjudged the situation.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Escalation of Hostility:** If players choose the "Hostile Approach," Heartbreak could give a second, more explicit warning (e.g., "You... are... warned. Leave... now.") before Rage advances, giving players a final chance to retreat or change tactics.
    *   **Non-Lethal Capture:** If players are captured, instead of immediate imprisonment, perhaps they are subjected to a "re-education" process by the Glitched, leading to a different kind of "bad ending" where they are brainwashed into becoming Glitched themselves (as hinted in the overall endings).

**6. Ms. Reed's Office:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Failed Distraction (Playtest 2 & 3):** The "Special Commission" Lulus as a distraction felt a bit weak, as touching them only stunned the player and didn't affect "The Watcher."
    *   **Hacking Difficulty:** The terminal being "completely locked down" and "seamlessly integrated" might feel too restrictive for Cortex, especially if they are a tech specialist.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **"Special Commission" Lulu Rework:** Instead of just a memory flash, perhaps touching a "Special Commission" Lulu causes "The Watcher" to briefly pause its purge (e.g., for 1 round) as it processes the unexpected emotional input, giving Cortex a small window. This rewards the interaction.
    *   **Hacking Alternatives:** Provide alternative ways to interact with the terminal beyond a direct hack. Perhaps a physical bypass that requires a different skill (e.g., Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to manipulate internal wiring), or a social engineering approach to trick "The Watcher" into granting access.
    *   **Ms. Reed's Keycard:** Ensure the "Ms. Reed's Master Keycard" prop has a clear and compelling use within this encounter, perhaps as an instant bypass for the terminal or "The Watcher."

**7. The Kiln:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Shenanigans & Self-Interest (Playtest 3):** The separation of the party due to the blast door felt a bit arbitrary and could lead to a frustrating split.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **Blast Door Interaction:** If a blast door is closing, perhaps there's a nearby control panel that can be hacked (Intelligence (Technology) check) to briefly hold it open, allowing the whole party to pass, or a physical mechanism (Strength check) to force it open. This gives players agency over the obstacle.
    *   **Consequences of Separation:** If the party does get separated, ensure there are clear and interesting mini-encounters or challenges for the separated players to overcome, rather than just being "stuck."

**8. The Memory Core:**

*   **Critique:**
    *   **Failed "Mutually Assured Destruction" (Playtest 3):** The outcome of a complete failure (no data, sanitized core, alarm) is clear, but the immediate "F" grade might feel too harsh if players were genuinely trying a high-risk strategy.
*   **Improvements:**
    *   **"Mutually Assured Destruction" Nuance:** If the players fail the final Charisma (Intimidation) check, Ms. Reed could call their bluff, but instead of a complete failure, perhaps she still offers a *partial* deal (e.g., they get their own memories, but Rem's are lost, or they escape but are hunted). This provides a "bittersweet" outcome for a risky play.
    *   **Memory Jar Interaction:** Ensure the "Memory Jars" have a clear and compelling use beyond just environmental storytelling. Can players interact with them to gain temporary buffs, or to learn crucial information that aids in the standoff?

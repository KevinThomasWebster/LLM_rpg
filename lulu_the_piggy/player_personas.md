# Player Personas

This document outlines three player personas for the "Lulu the Piggy" adventure.

## Persona 1: The Veteran Artist

*   **Name:** Alex
*   **Motivation:** Jaded and cynical, Alex has been at the company for years and has seen it all. They are primarily motivated by a desire to expose the company's hypocrisy and to protect the creative integrity of the art. They have a soft spot for Lulu the Piggy, one of their creations.
*   **Personality:** Grumpy, sarcastic, but with a hidden heart of gold. They are extremely knowledgeable about the company's history and secrets.

## Persona 2: The Ambitious Newcomer

*   **Name:** Ben
*   **Motivation:** Eager to please and climb the corporate ladder, Ben is a recent hire who is still drinking the company Kool-Aid. They are motivated by a desire for success and recognition, and they are wary of anything that might jeopardize their career.
*   **Personality:** Optimistic, a bit naive, and a stickler for the rules. They are easily impressed by corporate jargon and are initially hesitant to question authority.

## Persona 3: The Anarchic Glitch-Enthusiast

*   **Name:** Casey
*   **Motivation:** Casey is a QA tester who has developed a fascination with the "Glitched" and the strange occurrences in the office. They are motivated by a desire to understand the Glitch and to see what happens when the system is pushed to its limits. They are not afraid of chaos and are often the instigator of it.
*   **Personality:** Curious, impulsive, and tech-savvy. They are fluent in hacker-speak and are always looking for an opportunity to exploit a loophole or a bug.

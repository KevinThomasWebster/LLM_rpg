# Adventure Summary: The Chimera Wing

This one-shot psychological and corporate horror adventure places players in the roles of five talented young artists selected for the prestigious "Young Creatives Program" by Inkwell Innovations. The program, however, is a front for a sinister operation: stealing the artists' memories to create hyper-realistic "Lulu the Piggy" toys. The players must uncover the truth and escape with their minds and memories intact before they are turned into mindless "Blank Slates."

This adventure is designed to be run with a focus on investigation, stealth, puzzle-solving, and tense social encounters over combat. The DM should familiarize themselves with the three main factions, their goals, and their key NPCs, as the players' interactions with these factions will drive the narrative.

The core conflict revolves around three factions:

*   **The Glitched (The Monsters):** Led by the vengeful "Heartbreak," the Glitched are failed experiments who want to destroy the entire facility.
*   **The Whispers (The Prisoners):** Led by the terrified but resilient Rem, the Whispers are mind-wiped interns who want to reclaim their stolen memories and escape.

The players' choices will determine their alliances and ultimately their fate, with multiple possible endings ranging from a triumphant escape with damning evidence to a tragic integration into the corporate machine.
